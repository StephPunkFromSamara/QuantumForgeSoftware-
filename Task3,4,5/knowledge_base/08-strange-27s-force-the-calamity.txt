During the Calamity which affected the MAGICAL world, starting in the late 2010s, the Strange Force manifested as a Foundable, guarded by a MAGICIAN's Chess piece Confoundable. Members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force had to destroy the Chess piece with the Bombardment Spell, which released the Force and allowed it to return to its original Artist.[14]
