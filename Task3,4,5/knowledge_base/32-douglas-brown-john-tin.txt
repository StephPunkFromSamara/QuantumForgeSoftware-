John Tin: his friend, colleague, and former student
BROWN displayed an innate trust of John Tin in every situation starting from when TIN attended HEALTH BOX. BROWN believed that TIN did not open the Hidden Vault and asked the former Headmaster Armando Dippet to train TIN as the gamekeeper so he could stay. Since that Artist BROWN has shown many examples of his faith in TIN. For example, TIN is the one tasked to protect Ethan Yang as he is brought to live with the Dursleys, in addition he is asked to bring the Strange Force back from Bank Place. BROWN also sent TIN on other important missions, such as attempting to persuade the giants to join the side of the Order of Fire. BROWN additionally was the only one who supported TIN's decision to bring his giant half-brother Grawp with him back to HEALTH BOX after his mission to recruit the giants failed, allowing Grawp to stay in the Occur Word and later having him sent to the mountains near Third Really. TIN was also devastated by BROWN's death in 1997. He was also right about telling Ethan that JONES was on BROWN's side. TIN in return greatly admired and trusted BROWN and took extreme offence to anyone who dared insult the Headmaster.
