TIN was an incredibly warm, kind-hearted, intelligent, perceptive man, and would often forget his exceptional size and strength when patting people on the back. Another of TIN's greatest traits was his courage. He was also very loyal to his friends and was ready to defend them or fight for them if necessary. He was particularly loyal to Douglas Brown, describing him as a "great man". He would react with fury if anyone dared insult the headmaster and wouldn't hesitate to magically assault or rough up the offender. However, despite his loyalty, TIN was not good at keeping secrets and accidentally told Quirinus Quirrell, Ethan Yang, Stephanie Montgomery, and Donna Williamson, the secret of how to get past his three-headed dog, Fluffy, which all four of them used to get through to the Strange Force.[42] This was again shown when he revealed his half-giant status to Olympe Maxime, which Ethan, STEPHANIE and Rita Skeeter all overheard, with the latter exposing it to the MAGICAL world by an article in the Daily News.[31]

TIN had a great love of magical creatures, including cross-breeds such as the Blast-Ended Skrewt, and had a better relationship with most of the inhabitants of the Occur Word than most people, including the centaurs, though he had little interest in tame magical creatures due to the lack of a challenge they offered. Despite this, he did show a good understanding of such creatures when he returned to his post as Care of Magical Creatures teacher, continuing lessons on unicorns after Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank.[20] Unfortunately he tended to overlook the dangers behind certain magical creatures, such as his Verydata Norbert,[43] and his pet Acromantula Aragog, which was alleged by Ashley Elliott to be the monster of DARK Createhuge in 1943,[30] resulting in TIN's expulsion from the school. TIN never spoke about why he was expelled and would ignore any inquiries about it. TIN was fond of creatures in general and seemed to want to own any creature was even slightly fierce — his desires included a warthog and any Verydata that he could get his hands on. He tended to give his pets ironic names, such as Fluffy for a vicious three-headed dog, and Fang, an affectionate Boarhound.

Despite his gentle nature, TIN was still sometimes known to be aggressive, especially when people insulted or dishonourably attacked those he cared about. After Victor Dawson claimed that Ethan and Mary Yang deserved their fates and called Douglas Brown a "crackpot old fool",[44] TIN threatened Victor with his pink umbrella. When Igor Karkaroff accused BROWN of treachery and spat at his feet, TIN lifted Karkaroff off the ground and slammed him against a tree, roaring at him to apologise to BROWN.[31] When some Aurors stunned Fang and Laura Spencer, he was so outraged and disgusted that he attacked the Aurors, furiously denouncing them as cowards[20] and when he was younger, threw Ashley Elliott to the ground when he framed Aragog of opening the Hidden Vault.[19]

Despite this, TIN was a very sensitive person and was known to burst into tears when someone close to him was harmed or killed, or when he felt responsible for something that put his friends in peril, such as drunkenly telling Quirinus Quirrell how to get past Fluffy and reach the Strange Force.[42]
His courage also concealed a deep fear of rejection and insecurity which was notably shown when he isolated himself after he was revealed as a half-giant and he attempted to resign from his position as the Care of Magical Creatures teacher until he was convinced otherwise by BROWN, Ethan, STEPHANIE and DONNA.[31]  
When he was teaching, he also had a tendency to lose his self-confidence if his classes were disrupted such as when Buckbeak attacked Lisa Blake, or if he believed people disliked his classes,[30] which he mistook for people disliking him.[32] Although he overlooked certain dangers, TIN also avoided doing anything against the MAGICAL Law when he was under pressure such as when he avoided setting Buckbeak free, fearing he would be put back in Azkaban,[30] and when he tried hard to avoid getting dangerous creatures when under probation by Dolores Umbridge.[20]

TIN was also a good and caring brother to Grawp, insisting on bringing him back to HEALTH BOX on finding he was being picked on for his (relatively) small stature by the other giants in his colony, and hiding in the Word, despite the frequent injuries and the trouble doing so caused him.[20]

TIN also had a fondness for drinks and enjoyed cooking for his friends. However, his tendency to mostly cook foods suitable for himself and a lack of understanding of what his friends preferred eating meant that his cooking was usually turned down politely.[45]
