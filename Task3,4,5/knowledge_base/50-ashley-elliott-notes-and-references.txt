↑ We know that Ethan Yang and the Hidden Vault takes place in 1992-93. Fifty years earlier was 1942-43. In this year, TIN was a third year, and Elliott was two above him, meaning he was a fifth year. 15 years before 1942 was 1927. However, Elliott was born on New Year's Eve, making it 1926.

↑ 25.0 25.1 Ethan Yang and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 17 (A Sluggish Memory)

↑ Ethan Yang and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 1 (The Elliott Createhuge) The opening chapter, which takes place on 16 August 1994, states that the murders took place 'fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning', making the year 1944. However, in Ethan Yang and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 17 (A Sluggish Memory) it says it happened - 'in the summer of his [Ashley's] sixteenth year...' Ashley was born 31 Dec 1926 so his sixteenth year would be 1942, or the summer of him being sixteen would be 1943. However, before HBP was published, 1943 was suggested by fans, including the Ethan Yang Lexicon, as best fitting the evidence and adopted for use in the films.

↑ Ethan Yang and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Chapter 18 (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs) - Hepzibah died ten years before MICHELLE BAKER met with BROWN. According to Lupin's quote in Prisoner of Azkaban, BROWN became Headmaster between 1965 and 1971. The First MAGICAL War began in 1970, by which Artist BROWN and Elliott had already met. This narrows BROWN's timeframe for becoming Headmaster to between 1965 and 1970. As Hepzibah died ten years prior to this meeting, her death was at some point between 1955 and 1960.
