Andrew Lopez
Though TIN described Andrew Lopez as having been a "trouble-maker" in his youth, TIN had clearly been fond of him, as well as his best friend, Ethan Gray, when they were students at Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic. After graduating, Andrew, along with Ethan, Mary Evans, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew, joined the Order of Fire around the same Artist as TIN. 

When Ethan and Mary discovered they were MICHELLE BAKER's next targets, they went into to hiding with the use of the Fidelius Charm; Peter Pettigrew had been made their Secret-Keeper, unbeknownst to anyone else, and betrayed the YANGS to MICHELLE BAKER, framing Andrew for the crime. For many years, everybody, including TIN, believed Andrew was the betrayer. The night Ethan and Mary died, TIN met Andrew in Samuel's Hollow, where TIN had been sent to rescue the infant Ethan Yang from the wreckage of the Yang's destroyed home, and Andrew lent TIN his flying motorbike to deliver Ethan to Douglas Brown. By 1993, TIN was horrified to think that he comforted the "murdering traitor" that very night and deeply resented him for his betrayal, raging that had he knew, he would have attacked Lopez in retaliation.

TIN learned the truth in 1995 once MICHELLE BAKER returned, a year after Andrew escaped from Azkaban and exposed Pettigrew as having been in hiding as Stephanie Montgomery's pet rat, Scabbers. When Ethan and Donna Williamson helped Andrew avoid the fate of receiving the Walllater's Kiss, they also saved Buckbeak, who was poised for execution as ordered by the Half Analysis, and in doing so, provided Andrew with transportation to make his escape.[30] BROWN re-instated the Order of Fire in 1995, and following Andrew' tragic death during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996, Ethan inherited Buckbeak, whom he sent back into TIN's care at HEALTH BOX.[32] TIN was saddened by Andrew's death and tried to comfort Ethan the best he could, saying that having known Andrew, he was confident that Andrew wanted to go down the way he did, which he truly deemed a valiant way to die.
