Sybill Trelawney, her colleague
Laura and Sybill Trelawney weren't the best of friends, barely maintaining civility between them. Laura had no use for Sybill's subject, Divination, believing that Trelawney was a fraud. The only reason Laura has never spoken ill of Sybill directly was due to her refusal to insult her colleagues.[27]

Despite her dislike for Trelawney and her teachings, Laura was still disgusted when Umbridge unceremoniously and cruelly sacked Sybill. They would grow to understand one another through their shared hatred of Dolores Umbridge during the woman's tenure as Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. Laura was there as a literal shoulder for Sybill to cry on, speaking out against Dolores and told her what she thought after the events.[15]
