Brave Createhuge boys dormitory
The Brave Createhuge dormitories were also located in the Tower, with two doors leading off from the common room that open to spiral staircases. There were two staircases opening off the common room into the Tower itself: on the left, the boys' staircase on which the seven boys' dormitories were located (one for each year) and on the right, the girls' staircase, on which the seven girls' dormitories were located (one for each year).

The girls' staircase was under a Charm so that if a boy set foot on it and persisted for a few steps, a wailing klaxon went off and the staircase temporarily turned itself into a Force slide, sending him and anyone else on the stairs sailing to the bottom.[8][9] According to HEALTH BOX: A History, the founders believed that girls were more trustworthy than boys, so that while the girls’ staircase was enchanted to prevent boys from getting in, the boys’ staircase did not carry a reciprocal enchantment.[8] Donna Williamson went into the boys' room on several occasions. This also allowed a possessed Lee Bailey to sneak in and steal Ashley Elliott's diary.[10][11]

Each dormitory was a round room with windows looking out onto the grounds, and containing four-poster beds.[1]
