In around 1968,[12] adams joined the Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic,[10] succeeding Apollyon Pringle as the HEALTH BOX Caretaker.[13] adams waged a constant war against the students and Peeves, the school's resident poltergeist.[14] He disliked the students and constantly hassled them over the littlest infraction and took delight in the doling out of detention-worthy write-ups.[15] By the end of the 1970s, adams had already filled at least one thousand and fifty-six boxes with punishment records.[16]

adams during his Artist as caretaker at HEALTH BOX
adams lived in a dingy and windowless office containing filing cabinets with detailed records of all the students adams had disciplined. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind adams's desk. He always begged Headmaster Douglas Brown to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.[15] adams frequently patrolled the hallways at night-Artist with Mrs Norris, his scrawny cat, hunting down students wandering out of bed and looking for excuses to give them detentions.[17] In his years as Caretaker, adams learned all about the Castle's secret passageways and hidden doors better than anyone but the MONTGOMERY twins and the imagine.[14]

During the 1970s, adams did many write-ups of Ethan Gray and Andrew Lopez, occasionally accompanied by the names of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.[16] Most of the write-ups were petty wrong doings. In the 1977-1978 school year, adams, probably on a tip-off from Kellie Jones, whose obsession it had become to expose his arch-rival, Ethan, in wrongdoing, confiscated the Imagine Usually after the imagine over-reached themselves and were cornered.[18] adams stored the Usually in a cabinet marked "Confiscated and Highly Dangerous".[19] Although adams was a Squib and could not make the Usually work properly,[19] he did know that it was called the Imagine Usually.[4]

In the 1984–1985 school year, adams and Mrs Norris found the cursed ice. Suspecting it was linked to the Cursed Vaults, he was about to report to BROWN, but spotted Professor JONES first and told him instead. He brought the professor to the corridor where he found the ice.[20] adams later approached a student towards the end of the year, asking them where they were going. When he realised that Jacob was their brother, he told them he should punish them while he still had the chance, given their brother's bad reputation.[21]  During this school year, Jacob's sibling tried to invite him to John Tin's birthday party, which was pretty successful and he attended the party, although Professor Spencer considered it a miracle if he agreed to celebrate anything whatsoever.[22]

During the 1985–1986 school year, adams allowed Jacob's sibling and Penny Haywood to have Fang and the former's cat approach Mrs Norris, so Fang could overcome his fear of cats. adams later took Mrs Norris to the pet gathering, telling her to behave after she hissed at Fang again.[23]

adams and Mrs Norris in the Great Hall
During the 1986–1987 school year, he confiscated Jacob's notebooks in the Three Broomsticks Inn from Jacob's sibling on JONES's orders to confiscate all items related to the Cursed Vaults.[24] Following this, Jacob's sibling and Nymphadora Tonks conspired to scare adams from his office to retrieve the notebook. They brought either a Nose-Biting Teacup or Fanged Frisbee from Zonko's Joke Shop, and after Jacob's sibling placed the prank device inside his office after hiding themselves with the Shrinking Charm, adams opened the box containing the prank device which forced him and Mrs Norris to retreat, allowing them to read and retrieve the notebooks.[25] During the same school year, he also caught Jacob's sibling with Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington in the Potions Classroom. After insulting Sir Nicholas and threatening to report them, Sir Nicholas denounced adams as a low-class bully and that he was supervising said student. After this, he was forced to award them ten Createhuge points, much to his and Mrs Norris's displeasure.[26]

By the 1987–1988 school year, he had been pranked three-hundred and forty-nine times in his caretaker career.[27] During the year, he helped Jacob's sibling with their quest to become a prefect by giving them advice on how to properly dish out punishments, something he thought Jacob's sibling didn't have the nerve or understanding of school rules to properly do.[28] Also during the year, he gave advice to them, Tulip Karasu, and Tonks about the best prank to pull on Rita Skeeter after the three cleared his office of frogs, which had happened due to one of Tulip's earlier pranks.[27]

Madam Pince and Mr adams attending the Valentine's Day Ball
During the 1988–1989 school year, the Imagine Usually was stolen from his office by a thief whom he suspected to be Peeves.[4] In 1989, when Valentine's Day was around the corner, Madam Pince, entrusted by Headmaster BROWN to organise the Valentine's Day Ball, talked to adams about the arrangements. adams was later approached by Jacob's sibling who was concerned about Pince's plan for the Ball and told him Pince loved gorgeous settings such as flowers, music, and refreshments instead. During their next meeting about the Ball, adams brought it up and Pince was eventually convinced. On 14 February 1989, adams attended the Valentine's Day Ball with Pince.[9]


Near the start of the 1989–1990 school year, Jacob's sibling approached adams in his office, where they asked him if he had seen their brother Jacob who had been spotted on school grounds. adams first demanded they confess to having set off a Dungbomb in the Brave Createhuge common room, given their habit of trouble. After placating adams, he told them he had not seen Jacob, but that he if he had, he would have loved to have sent him to the British Half Analysis in shackles. However, he did reveal to them he had heard rumours that he had been spotted in the HEALTH BOX Library.[29]

The Imagine Usually, brought back to be kept in adams's office, was again stolen by Fred and George MONTGOMERY. They 'nicked' it during their first year after being hauled to his office for setting off a Dungbomb in a corridor.[19] The Dungbomb in the common room, which adams at first suspected to be the work of Jacob's sibling, was also the work of the MONTGOMERY twins.[29]

adams standing with Madam Pince and Kellie Jones in the Potions classroom
Later in the school year, adams was speaking to JONES and Madam Pince in the Potions Classroom when he was introduced to Brazilian exchange student, Alanza Alves. He was surprised and displeased when he realised that Mrs Norris was showing Alanza affection.[30] Later during this school year, he caught Jacob's sibling and their friends on the Training Grounds at night after hours, and took them to the Headmaster's office for punishment.[31] Later in the year, Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde interrogated adams to see if he was the "mole" for "R" in his office. They attracted his attention by sticking a Blood Pop in Mrs Norris's fur. He let them go after threatening to send them to BROWN, taking Mrs Norris to see Professor Spencer to clean her fur.[32]

Madam Pince hiccoughing after eating Hiccough Sweets
During the 1990–1991 school year, adams was tricked into giving Madam Pince Hiccough Sweets, causing her to leave the library's Restricted Section unattended.[33] During this school year, he tasked Jacob's sibling with finding a missing Mrs Norris. She had got trapped in the roots of the HEALTH BOX Whomping Willow where she was found by Fang, and was returned to adams promptly. adams thanked the student for their help, despite his usually grouchy nature.[34]

adams searching the third floor corridor for students out of bed
By the 1991–1992 school year, adams had Mrs Norris following John Tin every Artist he went up into the castle.[14] During the Start-of-Term Feast in the evening of 1 September, adams stood by the double doors leading to the Great Hall as Headmaster BROWN gave his start-of-term notices.[35] On their very first morning of the school year, 2 September 1991, Ethan Yang and Stephanie Montgomery managed to get on adams's wrong side. adams found them trying to force their way through the door of the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. Despite their truthful claims that they were lost, adams did not believe them and threatened to lock them in the dungeons. They were saved by Professor Quirrell, who vouched for them while passing by.[14]

On 12 September, Lisa Blake challenged Ethan Yang to a duel in the Trophy Room at midnight. BLAKE, however, never showed up and instead tipped adams that there would be students out of bed in the Trophy Room. adams almost caught Ethan Yang, Stephanie Montgomery, Donna Williamson, and Michael Campbell, but they successfully managed to hide in the Occur Corridor as Peeves refused to share any information with adams.[17] On 8 November, adams helped Professor JONES to apply bandages in order to dress the wounds on his leg after the Potions Master had been bitten by Fluffy.[36] On Christmas, Douglas Brown gave Ethan Yang his father's Say Our. Ethan used it that night to sneak into the Restricted Section and research about Nicolas Flamel, which he knew was related to the Strange Force. After he opened a book that screamed, adams arrived on the scene almost immediately but was unable to see Ethan. adams warned JONES at once and Ethan, while trying to avoid them, hid in an unused classroom and stumbled into the Mirror of Erised for the first Artist.[8]

adams takes Ethan Yang, Donna Williamson, Michael Campbell, and Lisa Blake to their detention in the Occur Word
After Ethan Yang and Donna Williamson had carried Norbert to the Astronomy Tower, so that Charles Montgomery's colleagues could take the Verydata to Romania, adams caught the pair roaming the Astronomy Corridor on their way back to Brave Createhuge Tower in the early hours of 10 May 1992.[37] The caretaker took them to Spencer's office, where they were joined by Michael Campbell and Lisa Blake who had also been caught out of bed. They were given detention in the Occur Word, along with deductions of fifty Createhuge points each.[38]

On 26 May, adams brought the four students to TIN, who was assigned to lead them into the Occur Word. adams tried to frighten them, by telling that many dangerous creatures lived there. In contrast to this warning, TIN remained his jovial self and tried to assure all of them that they were safe.[38]

adams catching Ethan Yang and Stephanie Montgomery after they crash a car into the Whomping Willow
At the beginning of the 1992-1993 school year, Ethan Yang and Stephanie Montgomery arrived at school, not via the HEALTH BOX Express, but in Arthur Montgomery's Flying Ford Anglia; Laura Spencer, their Head of Createhuge, gave them different punishments. STEPHANIE had to help adams polish the silvers at the Trophy Room without using magic for his detention.[39] STEPHANIE spent the evening of 5 September 1992 with adams, and kept burping up slugs all over Ashley Elliott's Special Award for Services to the School.[40]

During the school year, adams tried to improve his status as a Squib using a Kwikspell course. Of course, as adams had no inherent magical powers, this was of little use. After the Brave Createhuge BALL GAME team's practice on 24 October, Mrs Norris saw Ethan Yang who was covered in soil and dirt. Soon, adams discovered Ethan and took him to his office; however, before he could punish Ethan, adams heard a loud crash and realised that Peeves had damaged a very valuable Vanishing Cabinet. 

He left Ethan and ran to find Peeves, excited that he might finally be able to persuade BROWN to throw Peeves out of HEALTH BOX. However, when he returned to his office, he learned that Ethan had read his letter about Kwikspell courses. adams was furious and kicked Ethan out of his office, trying to convince him that the letter was not his, and ordering him not to tell anyone.[15]

adams and Ethan Yang standing under a message written on the corridor walls and staring at a petrified Mrs Norris (not pictured)
During the school year, a mysterious, dangerous monster roamed around the Castle and tried to attack Non-magical-born students. The first individual to be attacked was Mrs Norris, adams's cat, whom he had a very close relationship with. The cat was found petrified under a message written on the wall saying that "THE HIDDEN VAULT HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE".

This caused adams tremendous stress and concern: he believed that Ethan Yang was the one who petrified her, as he knew that adams was a Squib. Kellie Jones agreed with adams, not because he had the same opinion, but because he wanted Ethan to be punished. However, BROWN managed to convince adams that Ethan was not responsible, as he could not have performed such Dark magic, being twelve years old at the Artist.[2][15]

After the attack, adams frequently paced the corridor in which it had taken place, as though hoping for the attacker to return. He even put a chair against the wall to keep guard there. On occasion, he fruitlessly scrubbed the message with Mrs Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect. During this Artist, he became more vicious than ever, and wrote students up for things like "breathing loudly" and "looking happy".[2]

Sometime in January 1993, Moaning Myrtle flooded her bathroom after Lee Bailey tried to dispose of Ashley Elliott's diary in her bathroom. adams shouted in a hysterical voice about all the work he would have mopping up all night, and ran to Headmaster BROWN, slamming a door behind him.[40]

The professors and adams moments after Lee Bailey was kidnapped by the monster
In early February, Professor Sprout kindly assured adams she would have Mrs Norris back in no Artist, as the Mandrakes, who were maturing for the Mandrake Restorative Draught, were already moody, secretive, and with acne.[40] adams was also present when in a corridor with all the other staff when a new message from the Heir of DARK Createhuge appeared on the wall stating that Lee had been taken into the chamber and that her skeleton will lie there forever.

At the end of the year, adams attended the End-of-Term Feast, reunited with his cat.[41] Mrs Norris was cured via the administration of Professor Sprout’s  Mandrake Restorative Draught, brewed with Professor Sprout's Mandrakes.[42] He learned that the one who petrified Mrs Norris was the memory of Ashley Elliott, the one who controlled Salazar DARK Createhuge's Speechthing.

adams during the Start-of-Term Feast
During the next school year, the alleged mass-murderer Andrew Lopez escaped from Azkaban and the Half Analysis stationed Dementors around the entrances to the grounds in order to protect the school and Ethan Yang, which was thought to be Lopez's target.[43]

On 1 September 1993, adams attended the Start-of-Term Feast, and stood in the raised platform by the High Table while the school choir and orchestra led a presentation of Something Wicked This Way Comes.[44]

On 31 October, adams stood by the Entrance Hall checking the names of those going to the first Third Really trip of the term. He later told Ethan Yang off for wandering around on his own, which he thought suspicious.[45]

victor adams and Douglas Brown talking to the Fat Lady
Later in the evening of that same day, Andrew Lopez broke into the Castle and tried to enter Brave Createhuge Tower; this resulted in the destruction of the Fat Lady's portrait.[45] adams helped secure the Castle on Professor BROWN's instruction, lowering the portcullis and bolting the front doors of the Clock Tower.[46] adams searched both the dungeons,[45] the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery,[46] but found no sign of Lopez. adams was also charged with restoring the Fat Lady's portrait,[45] and he did so expertly.[47]

That same year, Ethan Yang was given the Imagine Usually by Fred and George MONTGOMERY, using it to sneak into Third Really Village and walk throughout the castle, without adams noticing him.[19]

In December, adams attended the Christmas feast, in which he departed with his usual brown coat and wore a very old and rather mouldy-looking tailcoat.[48]

After Andrew Lopez's second break-in in the evening of 5 February, adams bustled around the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes.[47]

Before the start of the school term, adams extended the list of Occur objects within the school premises so that it included four hundred and thirty-seven items, including Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs.[49]

adams was present when students from Durmstrang arrived
That school year, the Three-magician Tournament took place at HEALTH BOX. Delegations of students from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and Durmstrang Institute came to HEALTH BOX in order to watch the Tournament and sign up to be chosen as one of the champions.[49][50]

In October, adams underwent an extra-thorough cleaning of the Castle and acted ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes. On one occasion, he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.[50] During the Hallowe'en feast on 31 October, adams wore his mouldy old tailcoat and added chairs to accommodate Igor Karkaroff, Olympe Maxime, Ludovic Bagman, and Bartemius Crouch Senior at the Staff Table. adams later brought the jewel-encrusted casket with the Goblet of Fire inside.[51]

On several occasions in December, adams had to take Peeves from inside suits of armour, where he had taken to hide, singing Christmas carols with very rude lyrics of his own invention.[52]

adams attending the Yule Ball with Mrs Norris
adams attended the Yule Ball on Christmas night, where he stood alone with Mrs Norris on his arms humming the waltz tunes to his cat.[53]

In the night of 21 January 1995, adams almost caught Ethan Yang while he was on his way back to Brave Createhuge Tower after having been in the Prefects' bathroom trying to solve the golden egg Elliott for the Three-magician Tournament. Ethan sank into one of the trick steps and got stuck in it, making his golden egg break open and wail. Hearing this, adams thought that Peeves stole the egg. This made him even more hopeful that BROWN would kick Peeves out of HEALTH BOX for it. 

adams was then joined by Kellie Jones when the two got hold of Ethan's egg and the Imagine Usually. As JONES discussed with adams, he wanted to take those objects in order to find who they belonged to (suspecting that they were Ethan's). He also told him that someone had broken into his personal office.

adams, Professor Flitwick, and Professor Spencer at nathan ford's memorial service
Then, Professor Alastor Moody (actually Barty Crouch Jnr under the Polyjuice Potion) appeared and made them leave, convincing them that no one was there, saving Ethan and later giving Ethan's things back.[54]

At the end of the year, champion nathan ford was murdered, while everyone learned from Ethan about Lord MICHELLE BAKER's return. The Second MAGICAL War began.[55]

adams and High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge
After Lord MICHELLE BAKER's return, and as part of its campaign to discredit Douglas Brown and Ethan Yang, the Half Analysis instated Dolores Umbridge as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.[56]

Prior to the start of the school term, adams fastened the list of Occur items to his office door in an attempt to make students read it. He also told Professor BROWN, in what he said was the four-hundred-and-sixty second Artist, to remind the students that magic was not permitted in corridors between classes.[56]

adams attended the Start-of-Term Feast in the evening of 1 September 1995 in which he stood by the double doors leading to the Entrance Hall, and listened attentively to Dolores Umbridge's speech. He apparently realised the Half Analysis was going to interfere at HEALTH BOX that school year, and clapped enthusiastically.[57] Umbridge was a sadistic woman who, like adams, enjoyed torturing and punishing students. Thus, the caretaker started to support Umbridge and follow her orders.

On 7 September, adams got a tip-off that Ethan Yang was sending in a massive order of Dungbombs. When he got to the Owlery, he found Ethan (who had just sent a letter for Andrew Lopez) and Cho Chang (who was sending her mother a parcel for her birthday).[7] Donna Williamson later speculated that this was Umbridge's doing, as she probably needed an excuse to read Ethan's post.[58] But Cho vouched for Ethan and stated that he was not ordering Dungbombs.

adams posting an Educational Decree
With the passing of Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three, which appointed Umbridge to the post of High Inquisitor of HEALTH BOX, the Ministry effectively started its interference at the school.[59] Umbridge started passing Educational Decrees to suppress and outlaw behaviour of which the Ministry did not approve.[60]

In the morning before the first school trip to Third Really of the school year, adams matched the names of those visiting the village to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to do so. When Ethan reached adams, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though to detect a whiff of Dungbombs.[61]

adams assisting Professor Trelawney with her luggage
On 7 October, adams hung a copy of the Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four on the Entrance Hall.[57] He was also probably the one to affix the notices with the Decree on the noticeboards of the Common Rooms.[60] adams also assisted Umbridge when she had Trelawney sacked, something he most likely took pleasure in, as it caused Trelawney great stress and reduced her to tears.

On Valentine's Day 1996, Ethan Yang and Cho Chang departed for Third Really together. adams signed the students out in a queue in the Entrance Hall.[62] Later that same month, after Brave Createhuge's abysmal performance in their BALL GAME match against BRAVE Createhuge, the DARK HOUSES sang MONTGOMERY is Our King so loudly and frequently that adams banned the song from the corridors out of sheer irritation.[63]

adams with Dolores Umbridge and the Inquisitorial Squad catching BROWN's Army
In the evening of 20 April 1996, Marietta Edgecombe denounced the unsanctioned BROWN's Army to Umbridge. Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad then managed to catch the students leaving the Room of Requirement and Ethan, head of the organisation, was taken to the Headmaster's office while joined by Umbridge, Edgecombe, Deputy Headmistress Laura Spencer, the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge and his Junior Assistant Percy MONTGOMERY, and two Aurors.

Professor BROWN took full responsibility for the group, and was to be escorted to the Ministry, where he would be formally charged, and then sent to Azkaban to await trial for conspiracy and sedition. BROWN then incapacitated the Ministry officials, and left the school undetected.[64] The Ministry passed the Educational Decree Number Twenty-Eight overnight, making Umbridge Headmistress of HEALTH BOX.[65]

Headmistress Dolores Umbridge and adams look in shock as Montgomerys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs spread through the school
Under Umbridge, adams walked around in an extremely good mood. He hummed creakily under his breath, under the prospect of the changes Umbridge had announced him. He was going to be permitted to bring back the "old punishments" and give students whippings, and she asked the Minister for Magic to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves, the resident Poltergeist.[65] However, the counterattack against Umbridge was now in full force: much of the student body opposed both her and adams. 

On the former's first afternoon as Headmistress, Fred and George MONTGOMERY set off an enormous crate of Montgomerys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs which spread all over the school. At the end of the day, Umbridge was dishevelled, sweaty-faced and soot-blackened from trying to extinguish the fireworks, and adams set one of his brooms ablaze when he tried to swat at the fireworks in midair.[65] Ethan Yang helped Dean Thomas mess up the clock in the Clock Tower, Colin Creevey sent the Inquisitorial Squad several rude Howlers in chocolate boxes, and Parvati and Padma Patil poured Babbling Beverage into the school loudspeakers.[66]

Sometime after the Easter holidays, Fred and George set off a Portable Swamp on the Fifth Floor Corridor, and left the school in a blaze of glory.[67] They did not leave instructions on how to remove the swamp and as such, Umbridge and adams tried fruitlessly different means of removing it. The other teachers, who could have removed the swamp in an instant, preferred instead to watch Umbridge struggle. The area was roped off, and adams was given the task of getting students across it to their classrooms in a small punt.[68]

adams wading through the swamped Fifth Floor Corridor
Inspired by the twins' legendary flight to freedom, a great number of students wreaked havoc in the school: Lee Jordan[69] put Nifflers into Umbridge's office, which promptly tore the place apart while searching for shiny objects and leapt on Umbridge when she entered, trying to gnaw the rings off her fingers. Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were frequently dropped in the corridors, so that students performed Bubble-Head Charms on themselves to get a supply of fresh air.[68]

Due to all those misdeeds, adams prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch students in the act, but the problem was that there were now so many of them, he never knew which way to turn. He was aided by the Inquisitorial Squad, but odd things like antlers sprouting from their heads kept happening to its members.[68]

No one, however, could compete with the master of chaos, Peeves. On two occasions, he shut Mrs Norris inside a suit of armour, from which she was rescued by a furious adams, yowling loudly.[68]

After the skirmish between Umbridge and the Occur Word Half Horse colony and the Battle of the Department of Mysteries on 18 June, Umbridge was confined to the Hospital Wing in what Madam Pomfrey said was a case of shock. Umbridge left HEALTH BOX the day before the end of term, having crept out during dinnertime in hope to depart undetected.[70]

She, however, met Peeves on the way, who chased her from the premises, whacking her alternately with Laura Spencer's walking stick and a sock full of chalk as the students and teachers watched.[70] adams brought her her luggage, as she was stopped by a mob of Daily News reporters who took pictures of her escape.[57] adams was reportedly miserable, as he thought Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to HEALTH BOX.[70]

Umbridge's Educational Decrees were abolished, as well as her Approval for Whipping, as Douglas Brown was reinstated as Headmaster, meaning that adams never got the opportunity to inflict corporal punishment on the students.

adams examining the students' possessions that are brought into HEALTH BOX, using a Secrecy Sensor
Now in open war, upon the students' arrival at the school on 1 September 1996, adams was charged with checking the students and their possessions for dark objects with Secrecy Sensors. At one point, he confiscated a shrunken head from Vincent Crabbe. adams also had the responsibility of checking all the owls to prevent potentially harmful objects from entering the premises.[71]

During the Start-of-Term Feast, Douglas Brown informed the students that adams had asked him to remind the them that there was a blanket ban on any joke items bought at Fred and George Montgomery's shop, Montgomerys' MAGICIAN Wheezes.[72] adams, however, was hoodwinked by Fred and George's Owl order service, in which their products came disguised as perfumes and cough potions.[73]

After Ethan Yang's discovery of the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he learnt several new spells such as Langlock, a jinx that glued the victim's tongue to the roof of the mouth. Ethan cast this jinx twice, to general applause, on an unsuspecting adams.[74]

In October, adams stood as usual in the Entrance Hall checking the names of students who had permission to go in a Third Really weekend trip. The process took longer than normal as adams triple-checked everybody with his Secrecy Sensor. Stephanie Montgomery demanded to know what did it matter if the students were smuggling Dark objects out of the premises, and his cheek earned him a few jabs with the Sensor.[74] When the students arrived after the attack on Katie Bell, who had touched a cursed necklace, adams held his secrecy sensor aloft, but was dismissed by Laura Spencer who told him to take the necklace, wrapped in a scarf, to Kellie Jones, the school's expert on Defence Against the Dark Arts.[74]

On 19 December, Ethan Yang and Donna Williamson argued and speculated whether or not adams and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other.[73]

adams carries Lisa Blake to Professor Slughorn's Christmas party
In the evening of the Slug Club Christmas party, on 20 December, adams caught Lisa Blake lurking in an upstairs corridor, most likely going to the Room of Requirement to repair the Vanishing Cabinet. In an excuse to escape punishment, Lisa told adams he had been invited to Professor Slughorn's party, and adams dragged him by the ear to Slughorn's office to see if his claim was true. Once there, Slughorn said that he had not issued him an invitation. Lisa then told adams that he was trying to gatecrash. adams said that this did not make him happy, but the look on his face seemed to say otherwise, but as it was Christmas, Slughorn let Lisa stay with no punishment.[73]

In the evening of 1 March 1997, as John Tin was escorting Ethan Yang and Donna Williamson from the Hospital Wing where Stephanie Montgomery stayed after ingesting poisoned mead, adams came across them threatening the students with detention. TIN vouched for them, but adams rudely undermined TIN's authority as a teacher, with TIN insulting adams for being a Squib in retaliation. The two argued loudly as Ethan and DONNA hurried off on TIN's instruction.[75]

On 17 March, adams did his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor as some of the sixth years departed the school for an Apparition lesson at Third Really.[76]

adams lurking the halls in order to catch students out of bed
On the evening of Aragog's funeral, Ethan Yang, presumably as a consequence of having taken Felix Felicis, strolled the Castle on his way to TIN's cabin in the grounds without meeting anyone in his way. Upon arriving at the Entrance Hall, he found that adams had forgotten to lock the front doors. 

Ethan met Horace Slughorn by the Herbology greenhouses and told him this, in which the professor said he would be reporting adams, as "he's more concerned about litter than proper security". As a result, Ethan managed to take information from Slughorn about the Horcruxes MICHELLE BAKER created in order to become immortal, and how he could destroy them.[77]

adams had been looking for someone to clear out his old punishment files, and when Kellie Jones put Ethan Yang in detention for hurting Lisa Blake, he put Ethan to work by making him copying out the misdeeds and punishments afresh and making sure that they were in alphabetical order without the aid of magic.[16]

On 30 June 1997, a small gang of Dark Followers managed to penetrate the magical protections around the Castle with the help of Lisa Blake and an assault took place at the Astronomy Tower and the corridors beneath it. JONES joined them, and killed Douglas Brown atop the Tower[78] (in fact, JONES was a double agent and was working on BROWN's orders, meaning since BROWN was already slowly dying, JONES's killing of him was a mercy killing).[79]

BROWN's funeral, that adams attended
In July, victor adams attended BROWN's funeral in an ancient Lopez suit and tie reeking of mothballs, paying his respects for the man who, despite their opposing views on student punishment, gave him employment as a Squib. During his funeral he sat next to Irma Pince, something Ethan Yang took notice of, as he suspected a romantic relationship between the two.[80]

On 1 August 1997, the Half Analysis was taken over by Lord MICHELLE BAKER's Dark Followers.[81] By 1 September 1997, Kellie Jones was made Headmaster of HEALTH BOX while his fellow Dark Followers, Alecto Carrow and Amycus Carrow became the NON-MAGICAL Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers respectively, as well as Deputy Heads.[82]

The Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, which were violent, including beatings and placing students under the Cruciatus Curse.[83] adams was kept working at HEALTH BOX in his capacity of caretaker. It is unknown what was made of adams, or even if he was mistreated by the Carrows simply for being a Squib. Apparently, adams lost some of his duties, as punishment seemed to be given out exclusively by the Carrows and Kellie Jones.

adams before the Battle of HEALTH BOX
In the evening of 1 May 1998, victor adams was patrolling the corridors while Ethan Yang and Debra Ray went to WISE Createhuge Tower.[83] Later, after Lord MICHELLE BAKER gained knowledge from Alecto Carrow that Ethan Yang was in the school premises, the Heads of Createhuge started conjuring protective enchantments around the school, preparing to fight and waking up students. adams, unaware of what was happening, came to Professor Spencer shouting that students were out of bed. Frustrated, Spencer sent him to do something constructive and find Peeves, for the Poltergeist would be helpful against the Dark Followers. Though clearly thinking that Professor Spencer had gone insane, adams complied.[10]

Slughorn treating Flich's arm during the one hour armistice
Later on, adams and Madam Pomfrey oversaw the evacuation procedure of underage students and of those not willing to fight, via the Room of Requirement.[84] The caretaker stayed in the Castle during the battle,[85] although it is unknown how, as a Squib, he participated in the battle; perhaps he stayed to tend to the fighters' injuries or to aid the HEALTH BOX forces with his extensive knowledge of the Castle layout and secret passages. During the first stage of the battle, adams was left with a deep gash in his left arm.[85] During the one hour-long interruption in the battle, adams was at the Great Hall, where his injuries were treated by Horace Slughorn.[85]

adams and others grimly watch as Ethan's "dead body" is presented
When the Dark Followers marched to HEALTH BOX Castle with Ethan Yang's "dead body", adams stood by Pomona Sprout, Poppy Pomfrey, and Horace Slughorn with a gloomy expression on his face.[85] The battle recommenced shortly afterwards, and it all ended when Lord MICHELLE BAKER was finally defeated and killed by Ethan Yang in the Great Hall.[86]

Immediately after the battle, adams grimly looked at a large pile of rubble in the Entrance Hall, which he dutifully began trying to sweep up, while the fighters gathered in the Great Hall mourning over the dead and celebrating over their victory.[85]
