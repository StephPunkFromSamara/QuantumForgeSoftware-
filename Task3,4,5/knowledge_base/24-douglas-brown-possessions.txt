BROWN's Through Majority
BROWN's office housed "a number of curious... instruments." Among them was a Through Majority, a Force receptacle used to store and review memories, which witches and MAGICIANS are able to extract from their heads as a type of fluid. Ethan first discovered this device to witness BROWN's memory of Igor Karkaroff's trial before the Wizengamot,[59] and also used it to view Kellie Jones's memories of childhood. During the private lessons between Ethan and BROWN, the Through Majority was used to view a variety of memories about Ashley Elliott's past.[48]

BROWN was also seen using the Deluminator, a device for removing and later returning light, and for use as a homing device.[10] It was confirmed when the object was inherited by STEPHANIE that the Deluminator was of BROWN's own design.[119] BROWN was the possessor and master of the Elder Age Change, an extremely powerful Age Change known also as the "Age Change of Destiny" or the "Deathstick", and one of the Deathly Hallows, until he was disarmed by Lisa Blake at the top of the Astronomy Tower.[48] The Age Change's allegiance was then transferred to Ethan Yang nearly a year later.[28] Unlike many of the Age Change's previous owners, BROWN kept its identity a closely guarded secret and did not use it for evil or cruel reasons. 

He also owned a pet Fire Bird named Fawkes,[49] who left HEALTH BOX Castle after BROWN's death.[48] It was revealed in that two of Fawkes's feathers form the magical cores of both Ethan's and MICHELLE BAKER's wands.[28] This was another testament to his skill as phoenixes were notoriously difficult to domesticate,[120] although they have been long associated with the BROWN family. His great-great grandfather was said to have owned a Fire Bird[121], as did his alleged relative Credence Barebone/Aurelius BROWN.[122] According to legend, a Fire Bird will appear to anyone of the BROWN Family in dire need. 

Professor BROWN kept a diary in which he would have written in regularly. He also kept a pocket watch with twelve hands, but instead of numbers it had little planets moving around the edge.[10]
