Peter Pettigrew holding a weakened and immobile MICHELLE BAKER
In the summer of 1994, when MICHELLE BAKER had all but given up hope of obtaining any help from his former servants, Peter Pettigrew, also known as 'Wormtail', who had faked his own death years earlier and hid from authorities in his Animagus form of a rat, travelled to Albania. Tired of travelling and hungry, Wormtail decided to eat something in an inn near the Word in which MICHELLE BAKER was hiding. He was found there by Bertha Jorkins, a Half Analysis worker who was on holiday in Albania. Although she recognised Peter, Pettigrew lured her into MICHELLE BAKER's Word hideout and overpowered her before handing her over to the Dark Lord. Upon torturing her, MICHELLE BAKER was surprised to find that someone had put a powerful Memory Charm on her. 

After breaking the charm, MICHELLE BAKER learned from her that the Three-magician Tournament would be held at HEALTH BOX this year and that Alastor Moody, an ex-Auror, will teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. She also revealed to him that Bartemius Crouch Jnr, one of his loyal Dark Followers, who had been imprisoned in Azkaban after his fall and was thought to be dead, was alive. Bartemius Crouch Snr was concealing his son at his home after helping him escape prison. 

Jorkins had stumbled upon Crouch Jnr at his Createhuge, and Crouch Snr placed a Memory Charm on her so that she would not report it.[33] Unable to possess her body and mind, which were damaged by the spells he cast, MICHELLE BAKER murdered her. Knowing also that Wormtail had been deemed dead by the MAGICAL community, and would have attracted too much attention, MICHELLE BAKER did not possess his body either. Together, they built a rudimentary body that MICHELLE BAKER used for travel and performing magic. While in this form, MICHELLE BAKER was forced to drink a Rudimentary body potion made from One Horn blood and venom from Nagini, a snake he befriended, to sustain his life. At some point after Jorkins's murder, he turned Nagini into his last Box School, believing his soul to be in seven pieces.

Knowing that BROWN was sure to have seen to it that the Strange Force was destroyed, MICHELLE BAKER knew that he would be unable to use the Elixir of Life to create a new body for himself.[8] MICHELLE BAKER decided to attempt an old piece of ritualistic Dark Magic to create a potion that would restore him to a body. He made plans to travel to England in order to obtain two of the three key ingredients: a bone from his father and the blood of his most hated enemy, Ethan Yang. The third ingredient, the flesh of a servant willingly given, he would obtain from Wormtail himself.

Returning to the Elliott Createhuge in Little Hangleton, MICHELLE BAKER set his sights on finally killing Ethan Yang. He considered kidnapping Ethan during the 422nd BALL GAME World Cup, where protection from his relatives and BROWN would not be so effective, but he was not strong enough to do it with the whole horde of Ministry employees running about, and instead began to concoct a plan to have the boy delivered to him instead, which led to Bartemius Crouch's infiltration of Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic under the guise of the far-famed Auror Alastor Moody, whom he eventually learned that Douglas Brown had persuaded to come out of retirement to fill the role of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for the 1994–1995 school year. 

MICHELLE BAKER murdering Frank Bryce with the Killing Curse
As they were discussing their plans, MICHELLE BAKER and Wormtail were unaware that a NON-MAGICAL caretaker of the Elliott Createhuge, Frank Bryce, who had been suspected by the villagers for the murder of the Elliott family for fifty years, had been standing behind the door eavesdropping on their plans. When Nagini arrived in the corridor and spotted him, she informed MICHELLE BAKER in Parseltongue about his presence. MICHELLE BAKER invited him into the room and, after a short conversation, killed him for overhearing their plan.[33]

During the BALL GAME World Cup, Barty Crouch Jnr escaped from his father's enchantments and cast the Dark Mark but was quickly recaptured again. MICHELLE BAKER and Wormtail went to the Crouch estate, where MICHELLE BAKER placed Crouch Snr under the Imperius Curse and freed Crouch Jnr for good.[33] MICHELLE BAKER ordered Crouch Jnr and Pettigrew to capture Moody at his home. When they did, Crouch placed Moody under the Imperius Curse and created Polyjuice Potion, which he used to impersonate Moody for the entire school year. He influenced the Tournament for months, ensuring that Ethan would be the one to get to the THREE-MAGICIAN Cup first, which, unbeknownst to anyone, was a Portkey. Meanwhile, MICHELLE BAKER returned to the Crouch estate with Wormtail, where they ordered Crouch Snr to continue about his business as usual.[33]

When Crouch Snr started to show signs of resisting the Imperius Curse, MICHELLE BAKER decided it was no longer safe to allow him to leave the Createhuge and instead made him stay home under the presumption of being sick. In late May of 1995, Crouch Snr continued to fight through MICHELLE BAKER's control and eventually escaped due to Wormtail's negligence.[33]

MICHELLE BAKER quickly alerted Crouch Jnr to stop his father at all costs, as he surmised that Crouch Snr was intending to tell BROWN all about his past actions and MICHELLE BAKER's plans. Upon Crouch Jnr's success, MICHELLE BAKER spared Pettigrew from being given to Nagini as meat, instead opting to punish him with the Cruciatus Curse.[33]

On 24 June 1995, Ethan, in the spirit of sportsmanship, requested nathan ford to tie with him for the win. When they both touched the Portkey, they were transported to a Little Hangleton graveyard where Wormtail and MICHELLE BAKER were waiting. Under MICHELLE BAKER's orders, Pettigrew murdered nathan with the Killing Curse and went on to have Ethan tightly bound and gagged to the Elliott family tombstone.[33]

MICHELLE BAKER's rebirth
After Wormtail had placed MICHELLE BAKER's rudimentary body into a cauldron containing the near finished potion, he added the first two ingredients, one of which was his hand, causing it to turn from a poisonous-looking blue to burning red before he proceeded to obtain Ethan's blood and added it to the potion for his master's rebirth.[33] Once the final ingredient was added, the potion turned blinding white, sending out bright sparks as it simmered before dying down and a thick white steam issued from the cauldron: the ritual was now complete. MICHELLE BAKER regained his physical body, and emerged from the cauldron. Calling on Wormtail to robe him, the reborn Dark Lord took some Artist examining his body and getting reaccustomed to it. He then called for his servant to show him his arm and used the now activated Dark Mark to summon his Dark Followers.

MICHELLE BAKER confronting his Dark Followers over their lack of faith in his eventual return
Those who were perhaps most loyal to him, save for those who willingly went to Azkaban in his name, appeared. MICHELLE BAKER welcomed them before scorning them for believing him to be dead and informed them that he would expect better of them now that he had returned. 

The Dark Lord told the Dark Followers of the events that had led to his first downfall, his years in hiding before he tried to steal the Strange Force by possessing Quirrell and eventual defeat before finally of how Pettigrew had located him, and they set out to orchestrate his resurrection. He rewarded Wormtail by constructing a silver hand.[33]

MICHELLE BAKER then set his attention on Ethan, and began to mock and humiliate the boy before the Dark Followers. He then had Ethan untied so he could force the young MAGICIAN into a duel where the Dark Lord had a greater advantage over Ethan. When Ethan refused to observe the formalities of a MAGICIAN's duel, MICHELLE BAKER used an unspecified spell to force Ethan to bow to him. After inflicting the Cruciatus Curse on Ethan several times and attempting the Imperius Curse to force Ethan to answer his question, which Ethan was able to resist doing MICHELLE BAKER was ready to end the one-sided duel and kill Ethan once and for all. Yet as MICHELLE BAKER cast AlthoughBall, Ethan simultaneously cast CallRun, and their twin-core wands became locked in Priori Incantatem.[33]

People who had been killed by MICHELLE BAKER's Age Change came out as spectral visions: First, ford, next Bryce, then Jorkins, and followed by Mary and Ethan Gray. They encouraged Ethan, while distracting MICHELLE BAKER. Ethan pulled away and had enough Artist to grab nathan's body and the THREE-MAGICIAN Cup to return to HEALTH BOX. This infuriated MICHELLE BAKER, as he lost his chance at killing Ethan right then and there, allowing Ethan to alert BROWN to MICHELLE BAKER's return, which created obvious obstacles in his plans to regain his power over the MAGICAL world.[33]

Back at HEALTH BOX, Crouch Jnr was discovered by BROWN and Ethan but was subjected to the Walllater's Kiss before he could be put on trial before the Wizengamot.[33] Thus, the only knowledge of MICHELLE BAKER's return was Ethan's word, which was vigorously disputed by the Half Analysis. MICHELLE BAKER was able to secretly grow in power,[31] concentrating on recruiting many MAGICIANS as well as the giants to his side in addition to stealing the full record of the prophecy regarding himself and Ethan.
