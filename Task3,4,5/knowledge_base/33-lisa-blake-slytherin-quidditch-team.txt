Lisa Blake was the Seeker for the Slytherin Quidditch team starting his second year at Health Box. Blake appeared to be very popular with the team. This is most likely because during his second year his father bought the team new and faster brooms. Also, the rest of the team appeared to have the same views as he did because they smirked when Blake called Donna Williamson a 'Mudblood' and laughed when a curse backfired on Stephanie Montgomery after the disagreement with Donna Williamson.

Lisa also appeared to be somehow related to one of the team members — Marcus Flint — through his maternal 2nd great-grandfather, who married the pure-blooded Ursula of the Flint family.
