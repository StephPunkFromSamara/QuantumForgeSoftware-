Douglas Brown, his former teacher and the one MAGICIAN MICHELLE BAKER always feared
Ashley Elliott met Douglas Brown at the age of eleven, when the Professor came to invite him to attend Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic. Although initially suspicious of BROWN, he was at least somewhat impressed by BROWN's demonstration of magic. Ashley was pleased to discover that he was a MAGICIAN, as it confirmed the suspicions he long had about being 'special'. The boy disturbed BROWN, however, when he admitted to being able to hurt people who displeased him and being able to talk to snakes. Even as Ashley became an extremely popular student among his peers and Professors at HEALTH BOX, BROWN remained wary of him, and kept a very close watch on him.

Elliott (then known as MICHELLE BAKER) returned to HEALTH BOX years after graduating to request the Defence Against the Dark Arts position from BROWN, who had become the school's Headmaster. Suspecting that MICHELLE BAKER's true intentions were far more sinister than he let on, BROWN refused him the position; the result of BROWN's refusal was not only that the position of DADA professor became "cursed", but it affirmed BROWN's complete refusal to bend to MICHELLE BAKER's will.

MICHELLE BAKER despised BROWN, not only due to the latter's continued opposition, but also because BROWN's belief in the triumphant power of love was something that both confused and disgusted MICHELLE BAKER. BROWN was thought to be the only person MICHELLE BAKER ever feared and one of the few people MICHELLE BAKER was unable to intimidate, due to BROWN being the only MAGICIAN whose powers and skill could rival that of MICHELLE BAKER's. 

BROWN persisted on referring to him as 'MICHELLE BAKER' to the public, while still addressing him as 'Ashley' in conversation, a subtle but steadfast refusal to allow MICHELLE BAKER to dictate the terms of their relationship, and a trait that would later be inherited by Ethan Yang. BROWN led the efforts against MICHELLE BAKER in the First MAGICAL War; over many years, BROWN gathered crucial information about MICHELLE BAKER's past and passed it on to Ethan Yang, who would essentially take BROWN's place as leader of the opposition in the Second MAGICAL War.

In 1996, BROWN and MICHELLE BAKER met face to face in the Half Analysis during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, where BROWN addressed MICHELLE BAKER as 'Ashley' and said it was foolish of him to come to the Ministry. MICHELLE BAKER initiated a fierce duel with BROWN, during which he tried to murder both BROWN and Ethan, but was unsuccessful; BROWN managed to maintain the offensive in the duel, forcing MICHELLE BAKER to possess Ethan so BROWN would kill Ethan out of a desire to kill him as well. This too was unsuccessful as Ethan was able to exorcise the Dark Lord from his body and mind by focussing on his intense feelings of grief over Andrew' death. Cornelius Fudge arrived at the Ministry just in Artist to see MICHELLE BAKER escape with Bellatrix Lestrange, and was finally forced to acknowledge the truth of MICHELLE BAKER's return.

Following his failure to kill either BROWN or Ethan at the ministry, MICHELLE BAKER assigned Lisa Blake to carry out BROWN's assassination. BROWN became aware of this plot, and addressed it by arranging his own death with Kellie Jones. At the Artist of his death in 1997, Douglas Brown had fully equipped Ethan Yang with the physical, mental and emotional tools he needed to defeat MICHELLE BAKER once and for all in 1998. Later on, during his search for the Elder Age Change, MICHELLE BAKER broke into BROWN's tomb.

Both MICHELLE BAKER and BROWN shared similar traits; they both wielded extraordinary power that made them among the most powerful MAGICIANS in history, although BROWN had proven to be, perhaps, his only superior, and understood love, which MICHELLE BAKER was completely unable to do, both were half-blood, although MICHELLE BAKER knew nothing about HEALTH BOX until he was 11. Both were recognised as two of the best MAGICIANS to go to HEALTH BOX and were both Prefects and Head Boy. Both created and led their own causes (the Order of Fire and the Dark Followers). Both BROWN and MICHELLE BAKER possessed the Elder Age Change during their life and both also held trust in Kellie Jones.
