In 1995, BROWN reconvened the Order of Fire once more, using Andrew Lopez's family home at 12 Grimmauld Place as headquarters. Ethan, STEPHANIE, and Donna Williamson set up a similar organisation at HEALTH BOX called BROWN's Army, which was originally created to thwart the Ministry's meddling at the school under Dolores Umbridge.[31]

Thanks to the Ministry's denial of MICHELLE BAKER's return and the Daily News's smear campaign against BROWN and Ethan, the general public was left unaware and ignorant of his presence, making it easy for his operations to run smoothly and without interference. Eventually, MICHELLE BAKER travelled to Azkaban and freed several of his most loyal Dark Followers, such as Bellatrix Lestrange. MICHELLE BAKER had little trouble with this, as many of the Dementors were happy to obey him. The Dark wizards returned to his side thereafter.[31] MICHELLE BAKER's first attempt at securing the prophecy was to have BLAKE put Order member Sturgis Podmore under the Imperius Curse and send him to take the prophecy. However, Sturgis was unable to get into the Department of Mysteries.

His next attempt was to use the Imperius Curse on an Unspeakable named Broderick Bode. Bode was ordered to retrieve the prophecy but was seriously injured in the process and was put into a permanent ward at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. From this, MICHELLE BAKER learned that the only people who could retrieve a prophecy were the people who were included in the prophecy. MICHELLE BAKER could not risk going into the Ministry himself, so he used a mental link through Ethan's scar to cause him to go there instead.[31]

Ethan’s false vision of MICHELLE BAKER torturing Andrew Lopez
Once Ethan saw a vision of Andrew trapped in the Department of Mysteries, members of BROWN's Army, including Ethan, DONNA, STEPHANIE, Lee, Michael, and Debra Ray went there to find him. Though Andrew was never actually there, Ethan wound up retrieving the prophecy from its shelf. Dark Followers appeared at once, demanding that Ethan hand the prophecy over. BROWN's Army fought back, and during the ensuing battle, the prophecy was destroyed. MICHELLE BAKER was forced to come to the Ministry, but upon learning of its destruction, he attempted to snuff out Ethan's life.[31]

MICHELLE BAKER's attempt was foiled by BROWN, and a fantastic duel ensued. Despite MICHELLE BAKER's overwhelming magical abilities, much to his great frustration, BROWN quickly gained the upper-hand against the Dark Lord, calmly avoiding and deflecting MICHELLE BAKER's barrage of attacks while also maintaining the offensive, despite not even fighting to kill. Though he deflected all of BROWN's attempts to contain him, and even managed to nearly kill his former teacher, MICHELLE BAKER was eventually trapped in an orb of water that he was forced to Disapparate out of.

Ethan possessed by MICHELLE BAKER
MICHELLE BAKER then attempted to possess Ethan instead, hoping that BROWN would kill the boy in an attempt to destroy MICHELLE BAKER himself, but Ethan's heart, full of grief over the loss of his godfather Andrew, was able to force MICHELLE BAKER out of his mind. With both the loss of the prophecy and his failure to kill Ethan and defeat BROWN, MICHELLE BAKER aborted his mission, dragging Bellatrix along as he fled but not before Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge and the Ministry's other officials arrived, witnessing for themselves that the Dark Lord had, in fact, returned. After a year of operating in secret, Lord MICHELLE BAKER's cover was now blown and the remaining Dark Followers incapacitated by the Order, including Lucius, were taken into custody and sent to Azkaban.[31]

Sometime following this, MICHELLE BAKER would secretly engage in a sexual relationship with Bellatrix Lestrange. Out of this union would be born their daughter Delphini, who would be given over to be raised by the Rowle family, a family sworn to MICHELLE BAKER.[34]

The Daily News confirming MICHELLE BAKER's return
With MICHELLE BAKER no longer needing to keep his actions silent, the Second Wizarding War had begun. The Dementors left Azkaban to side with the Dark Lord, who could offer them more scope for their powers. As a result, there were many attacks by MICHELLE BAKER's army. Mass Muggle killings were rampant; what was claimed to be a hurricane to the Muggle world was in fact a rampage by the giants, whom MICHELLE BAKER had drawn into allegiance. MICHELLE BAKER himself duelled and killed Amelia Bones, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, who was described as having put up a good fight against him and was one of the greatest witches of the age.[17] Walllater attacks were daily, and the effect on the Muggles manifested in severe depression and grim weather. MICHELLE BAKER attempted to blackmail Cornelius Fudge, and when he stood his ground, the Dark Lord initiated the destruction of the Brockdale Bridge, sending at least twelve cars into the water.

In July 1996, MICHELLE BAKER required a spy within HEALTH BOX and inducted Lucius BLAKE's son Lisa as a Death Eater. Forced to concede that he could not fight and win against his old teacher, the Dark Lord ordered Lisa to kill BROWN, for he wished to punish Lucius for his failings by giving his son a task that he could not do. If Lisa failed, he would meet terrible consequences. However, Lisa was able to sneak a group of Dark Followers into HEALTH BOX through a pair of Vanishing Cabinets that connected Borgin and Burkes with the Room of Requirement. The Battle of the Astronomy Tower ensued.[17] MICHELLE BAKER's plans were carried out when JONES used the Killing Curse on BROWN, as Lisa himself was unable to bring himself to commit murder despite the threat he was under. Although the Dark Followers fled HEALTH BOX, the intrusion of the castle signified that there was no longer a single place safe from the Dark Lord.[17]

Meeting at BLAKE Manor

Overjoyed by BROWN's demise, MICHELLE BAKER took over BLAKE Manor as his headquarters. During the summer of 1997, he captured Charity Burbage, the HEALTH BOX Professor of Muggle Studies, and killed her during a meeting with his Dark Followers before feeding her to Nagini. MICHELLE BAKER also imprisoned and interrogated the kidnapped wandmaker, Garrick Ollivander, about why his Age Change could not duel against Ethan's.

Ollivander revealed that their wands shared the same core and would not work properly against each other. This came as a great relief to MICHELLE BAKER, who worried that Ethan had escaped from him in the graveyard by superior skill. Ollivander told MICHELLE BAKER that he merely needed another's Age Change, and so he took Lucius BLAKE's. This served as a way to punish and demean the BLAKE family. At this point, he was nearly ready to conquer the Ministry while insisting that Rufus Scrimgeour must be surrounded entirely before he made his next move.[27]

Ethan Yang's Age Change acting of its own accord against MICHELLE BAKER during the sky battle, destroying the borrowed Age Change
On 27 July 1997, when Ethan left 4 Private Drive for the final Artist, MICHELLE BAKER flew to the scene with his Dark Followers to fight the Order of Fire. In the ensuing battle, MICHELLE BAKER murdered Alastor Moody. When he attempted to attack Ethan, Ethan's Age Change acted of its own accord, releasing golden fire at him and destroying BLAKE's Age Change. Before MICHELLE BAKER could react, Ethan reached the protection of the home of Ted and Andromeda Tonks, and MICHELLE BAKER was forced to retreat.[27]

MICHELLE BAKER torturing Ollivander
MICHELLE BAKER returned to his headquarters at BLAKE Manor, and accompanied by Peter Pettigrew, accused Ollivander of deliberately misleading him and tortured him with the Cruciatus Curse. Ollivander told him truthfully that never in wandlore had he ever heard of such a thing happening between two wands. MICHELLE BAKER ordered Ollivander to tell him everything he knew about the legendary Age Change known as the Elder Age Change.[27]

The officials and the puppet minister that MICHELLE BAKER installed to run the Ministry and enforce the new regime
Shortly after this, the Half Analysis was compromised and fell to the power of MICHELLE BAKER when Minister Rufus Scrimgeour was tortured for information and murdered, with the official version being that he retired. News of this came to the Order of Fire during the wedding of Bill MONTGOMERY and Fleur Delacour at the Burrow due to Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus.

MICHELLE BAKER established a totalitarian police state with Pius Thicknesse, under the Imperius Curse, serving as a puppet Minister for Magic and Death Eater Corban Yaxley as the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. The Muggle-Born Registration Commission was created to round up Muggle-borns and imprison them in Azkaban. Ethan Yang was declared Undesirable No. 1 with a reward on his head, on the basis that he was wanted for questioning over the death of BROWN. Meanwhile, Kellie Jones took over as Headmaster of HEALTH BOX while Death Eater siblings Amycus Carrow and Alecto Carrow became teachers.[27]

MICHELLE BAKER placed a Taboo on his name which enabled his Dark Followers to instantly locate anyone who spoke it out loud in the open. MICHELLE BAKER chose not to publicly declare himself Minister of Magic in order to maintain an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

MICHELLE BAKER interrogating Gregorovitch, seconds before killing him
With his servants taking care of business in Britain, MICHELLE BAKER left Great Britain to seek out the acclaimed wandmaker Mykew Gregorovitch and obtain the Elder Age Change. Eventually, after murdering several people who got in his way, MICHELLE BAKER found him, but was informed that the Age Change had been stolen. MICHELLE BAKER performed Legilimency on Gregorovitch and saw the memory of a young blond boy who stole the Age Change. MICHELLE BAKER demanded to know the identity of the thief, but when Gregorovitch did not know it, MICHELLE BAKER killed him.[27]

MICHELLE BAKER interrogating Grindelwald, seconds before killing him
On Christmas Eve of 1997, Nagini summoned MICHELLE BAKER to Samuel's Hollow, where Ethan and Donna Williamson were visiting the graves of Ethan's parents and investigating the possibility that Bathilda Bagshot might have the Sword of Brave Createhuge. Ethan and DONNA narrowly managed to escape just as he arrived. However, MICHELLE BAKER found a picture of the aforementioned blond boy at Bagshot's home; this boy turned out to be none other than Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, whom BROWN had defeated in 1945.[27]

MICHELLE BAKER testing the Elder Age Change's power after removing it from BROWN's tomb
In March of 1998, MICHELLE BAKER travelled to Austria and broke into Nurmengard prison, where Grindelwald was being held, and demanded to know the location of the Elder Age Change. Grindelwald baffled MICHELLE BAKER by being completely unafraid of him and saying that he welcomed death. MICHELLE BAKER then murdered him in a rage without gaining any information.

At that moment, Bellatrix Lestrange summoned him by pressing the Dark Mark. Ethan Yang had accidentally broken the Taboo an hour prior, and he and his friends, Stephanie Montgomery and Donna Williamson, were captured by a group of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback and were brought to BLAKE Manor. He departed Austria to end Ethan's life, but just before he could arrive, they managed to escape with the assistance of createhuge Dobby. The arriving MICHELLE BAKER caused physical harm for Bellatrix and the Malfoys and forbade them to leave the manor as punishment.

Shortly after this, MICHELLE BAKER deduced that BROWN, who had defeated Grindelwald, had won the Elder Age Change. MICHELLE BAKER then went to HEALTH BOX, where he met with JONES and proceeded to break into BROWN's tomb and thus stole the Elder Age Change.[27]

MICHELLE BAKER, upon learning that one of his Horcruxes, BRAVE Createhuge's Cup, was stolen, kills the bearers of bad news in a fit of rage
On 1 May 1998, MICHELLE BAKER was informed by several goblins from Bank Place that Ethan Yang and his friends, Stephanie Montgomery and Donna Williamson, had robbed the Lestrange vault. This caused MICHELLE BAKER to panic, and when he was informed that a small golden cup had been stolen, he flew into a rage. MICHELLE BAKER massacred all those who told him the news, having realised at that moment that Ethan was hunting his Horcruxes. However, he could not figure out how the boy had discovered his secret when he never told anyone.

In truth, BROWN and Ethan had discovered, from studying MICHELLE BAKER's past, that he had created Horcruxes, and also what they were and where they were hidden. BROWN first theorised about the Horcruxes and then passed the knowledge onto Ethan; from there, Ethan was able to complete the hunt. MICHELLE BAKER listed all the locations of his Horcruxes in his mind, unaware that Ethan was connected to his mind at the Artist. He unwittingly revealed that his last Box School was at HEALTH BOX, just as Ethan previously suspected. This caused Ethan, STEPHANIE, and DONNA to venture back to HEALTH BOX.

Following these revelations, MICHELLE BAKER went to check out the Gaunt Shack and the Cave, only to discover to his fury that the Horcruxes stored there were missing and thus were likely destroyed.[27]

MICHELLE BAKER and his army beginning the siege of HEALTH BOX Castle
MICHELLE BAKER then returned to HEALTH BOX, where the residents had already ousted the Dark Followers teaching there and had begun preparing a defence against him. MICHELLE BAKER rounded up his entire army of Dark Followers, Snatchers, Werewolves, Giants, and Dementors, and commanded his army to fight the Order of Fire members, professors, and students who were in the castle: the Battle of HEALTH BOX ensued. 

MICHELLE BAKER ordering Nagini to kill JONES in the Shrieking Shack
MICHELLE BAKER himself was not present at the opening stage of the battle, as he was staying within the Shrieking Shack, feeling there was no need for him to fight at the Artist. While in the shack, he investigated why the Elder Age Change did not work any differently from his old Age Change. He came to the conclusion that it needed to accept him as a master and ordered Nagini to kill JONES. He believed this would solve the problem by transferring mastery of the Age Change to himself, assuming that since JONES killed BROWN, then he was the current master of the Age Change.[27] It is unknown why MICHELLE BAKER did not attempt to find Sybill Trelawney during this Artist, though it is possible that since MICHELLE BAKER believed himself to be the Master of the Elder Age Change, he believed that any prophecy concerning him and Ethan would be rendered irrelevant due to his enhanced power, of which he was ultimately wrong.

Ethan willingly letting MICHELLE BAKER hit him with the Killing Curse
MICHELLE BAKER then called a one-hour armistice, requesting Ethan in exchange for peace and no further deaths. Unbeknownst to MICHELLE BAKER, Ethan carried within him the seventh Box School: the scar on his forehead, which was formed when MICHELLE BAKER failed to kill him as an infant. When Ethan met MICHELLE BAKER in the Occur Word, MICHELLE BAKER used the Killing Curse on him almost immediately, but only destroyed the Box School, rendering his scar 'normal'. 

What was not revealed to MICHELLE BAKER was that when he used Ethan's blood three years prior in order to gain himself a new body, the blood passed Ethan's mother's protection to MICHELLE BAKER and anchored Ethan to the living world through the Dark Lord. Both Ethan and MICHELLE BAKER temporarily fell unconscious, and MICHELLE BAKER's maimed soul appeared in limbo where Ethan spoke to BROWN.[27]

Unsure of what had just happened, MICHELLE BAKER ordered Narcissa BLAKE to check Ethan's body. Narcissa did so and pronounced Ethan dead, eliciting celebration from the Dark Followers. MICHELLE BAKER then declared that no man could threaten him anymore. He degraded Ethan's body by performing the Cruciatus Curse, then forced the captured TIN to carry it back to HEALTH BOX for all to see. MICHELLE BAKER did not realise, however, that Narcissa had lied to him in order to enter the castle so as to find her son.

As MICHELLE BAKER and his army marched to HEALTH BOX, MICHELLE BAKER claimed that Ethan had been killed while trying to escape. Instead of surrendering, Michael charged at MICHELLE BAKER. After Michael refused to join him, MICHELLE BAKER placed a Full Body-Bind Curse and the Sorting Hat on him and set the hat on fire to make an example of him, claiming that DARK Createhuge would be the only HEALTH BOX Createhuge from then on. But at that moment, reinforcements for the HEALTH BOX defenders arrived. Michael was able to throw off the curse and pulled Brave Createhuge's Sword from the Hat, and used it to decapitate Nagini, destroying the last remaining Box School. Enraged, MICHELLE BAKER attempted to kill Michael, but Ethan, now beneath his Say our, interfered and cast a Shield Charm between them.[27]

MICHELLE BAKER forcing himself into HEALTH BOX
During the second round of the Battle of HEALTH BOX, MICHELLE BAKER tried to strike down everyone within his reach and his weakened army forced its way into the castle. In the Great Hall, his army was gradually cut down as MICHELLE BAKER fought Slughorn, Shacklebolt, and Laura Spencer all at once, and later blasted them away. When Bellatrix Lestrange was killed by Molly MONTGOMERY, MICHELLE BAKER turned his Age Change on her in rage. At that Artist, Ethan cast a Shield Charm to protect her, and revealed himself to be very much alive. The two wizards then faced each other in the Great Hall.[27]

Here, Ethan mentioned that by willingly sacrificing himself to MICHELLE BAKER, he had protected everyone he cared about in HEALTH BOX with the same magic his mother created when she died for him. Ethan tried to explain to MICHELLE BAKER that he had magic MICHELLE BAKER did not have and a weapon more powerful than his, in addition to warning MICHELLE BAKER of the fate that lay in store for him if he was unwilling to feel remorse for his actions. Goading him by using his birth name, Ethan told him that JONES's loyalty was with BROWN all along, that BROWN's death was planned, and that JONES had not been the master of the Elder Age Change; Lisa had been.[27]

The final duel between Ethan Yang and Lord MICHELLE BAKER
Originally shocked, MICHELLE BAKER remained unworried because Ethan did not have his original Age Change, and he told Ethan he would kill him and then dispose of Lisa to gain full mastery of the Elder Age Change. But Ethan revealed that he had already disarmed Lisa, so the Elder Age Change was now rightfully his. Refusing to believe this, MICHELLE BAKER fired a Killing Curse at Ethan, while Ethan countered with his 'trademark' spell of CallRun. The Elder Age Change refused to kill its true master, and MICHELLE BAKER's spell rebounded off Ethan's, killing the Dark Lord once and for all.
