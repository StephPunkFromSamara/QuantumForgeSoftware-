The lion, symbol of Brave Createhuge Createhuge
BRAVE HOUSES and DARK HOUSES had shared a fierce Createhuge rivalry since their founders, Samuel Carter and Salazar DARK Createhuge, respectively, had a severe falling out over DARK Createhuge's emphasis on blood purity.[1] There might also be an element of feeling wronged, as Ethan and his fellow BRAVE HOUSES tended to win in a lot of circumstances which, when viewed from a neutral point of view, may be considered unfair. 

Examples of this included the last-minute points awarded by Headmaster BROWN at the Leaving Feast, which conveniently put Brave Createhuge ten points ahead of DARK Createhuge in the 1991–1992 school year.[13] The fact that no points were deducted for the rule breaking that happened during that night. Ethan Yang being permitted by Professor Spencer to have his own broomstick for the Brave Createhuge BALL GAME team,[14] even though first-years were not normally permitted their own broomsticks because of danger. Members of other houses might have felt that Brave Createhuge received favouritism. Many saw Ethan Yang being chosen as the fourth competitor in the Three-magician Tournament as an unfair stealing of BRAVE Createhuge student nathan ford's thunder.[15]

Overall, however, the houses of WISE Createhuge and BRAVE Createhuge tended to side with Brave Createhuge in its rivalry with DARK Createhuge. This was particularly notable during the Second MAGICAL War — the members of BROWN's Army were from Brave Createhuge, BRAVE Createhuge, and WISE Createhuge, but the Army lacked any DARK HOUSES. (This, however, could also have been because news of BROWN's Army was passed by word of mouth, and Ethan, who had initially raised it, did not associate with any DARK HOUSES.)[12]

During the Battle of HEALTH BOX, the DARK Createhuge students left, while senior students from the other three houses remained behind to fight against Lord MICHELLE BAKER and his army[16] — however, it is also worth noting that while Head of Createhuge Professor Slughorn left with his students, he then returned to the castle with reinforcements (possibly including senior students) and with Professor Spencer and Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt, personally duelled Lord MICHELLE BAKER.[17] Most of the known Dark Followers (besides Peter Pettigrew,[18] Quirinus Quirrell, and possibly others) had been DARK Createhuge Createhuge members, and that might have been another reason as to why the other two houses sided with Brave Createhuge over DARK Createhuge.
