Donna Williamson, his friend and his godson's best friend
Andrew also met Donna Williamson during the 1993–1994 school year, following his escape from Azkaban. DONNA, like the rest of the MAGICAL world, initially believed that Andrew was the MAGICIAN who betrayed Ethan and Mary Yang to Lord MICHELLE BAKER. However, she learned the truth and even indirectly helped to clear any doubts of his innocence through her questions. Together with Ethan and STEPHANIE, she brought him food when he was hiding in a cave near Third Really during the 1994–1995 school year.

In 1995, she lived for a few weeks at Andrew's Createhuge, along with other members of the Order of Fire. It was then, however, that she started to see "flaws" in Andrew's character. Firstly, she severely disapproved of his indifferent and occasionally cruel treatment of his createhuge Kreacher despite the fact that Kreacher initially appeared to be disgusted by her and addressed her as "the Mudblood" (which DONNA often attributed to Kreacher being senile due to his old age.) 

Secondly, she grew to believe that Andrew could be very selfish when it came to Ethan, even voicing her theory that a part of Andrew had actually been hoping for Ethan's expulsion from HEALTH BOX so that Ethan would stay with him at Grimmauld Place instead of going back to school for his fifth year. She also thought that Andrew was attempting to live vicariously through her, Ethan, and STEPHANIE, but the two boys became angry and snapped at her when she expressed this belief. Nevertheless, she had a generally good relationship with Andrew, knowing him to be an ultimately good person, and was greatly saddened by his death at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, and was one of the last people to duel his killer Bellatrix Lestrange during the Battle of HEALTH BOX.
