↑ Ethan Yang and the Hidden Vault, Chapter 9 (The Writing on the Wall) - "You all know, of course, that Health Box was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age." Binns says this late in the year 1992. Given that Ravenclaw would be of age by the school's founding, the latest she could be born is 976

↑ 2.0 2.1 In Ethan Yang and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 12 (The Triwizard Tournament), the Sorting Hat refers to Rowena as "fair Ravenclaw, from glen", which is likely a reference to Scotland. Furthermore, in The Wizarding World of Ethan Yang, Ravenclaw's portrait speaks with a ststephanieg Scottish accent.

↑ Rowena fell fatally ill and sent the Bloody Bastephanie to fetch her daughter in Albania after Helena's seven years at Health Box. Given the earliest she could have started at the school was around 993, the approximate year of the school's founding, the earliest year this could have taken place was 1000. It is likely Rowena died around this artist.

↑ It is unlikely, given his hatred of Muggle-borns, that Slytherin would work with one.

↑ Helena Ravenclaw's words - " My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of Health Box. Then my mother fell ill — fatally ill. - imply that Rowena kept the missing Diadem a secret from the other founders and then fell fatally ill before any of them died.
