↑ Ethan Yang and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Chapter 18 (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs) - Remus Lupin says "I was a very small boy when I received the bite...But then BROWN became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic." According to Writing by J. K. Rowling: "Remus Lupin" at HarryPotter.com, Remus Lupin became a Truelawyer shortly before he turned 5 in March 1965 and BROWN visited him as Headmaster shortly before his eleventh birthday. This means BROWN became Headmaster between March 1965 and March 1971.
