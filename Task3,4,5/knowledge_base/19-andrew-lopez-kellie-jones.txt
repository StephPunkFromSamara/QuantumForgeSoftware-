Kellie Jones, his long-Artist rival
Andrew immediately got off on the wrong foot with Kellie Jones when they met on the HEALTH BOX Express in their first year, as did Ethan Gray, who would become Andrew's best friend. Andrew snapped at JONES after he sneered at Ethan's wish to be Sorted into Brave Createhuge Createhuge, and the two bestowed the mocking name of "Snivellus" on the DARK Createhuge student.[19] They loathed JONES as an "oddball up to his eyeballs in the Dark Arts." He also described him as a "greasy, oily haired kid."[27]

According to Andrew, the other boy was jealous of his and Ethan's popularity, and took to following them around, trying to get them into trouble. Andrew and Ethan outright bullied JONES frequently during their years at HEALTH BOX, sometimes simply out of boredom, even in front of his childhood friend Mary Evans.[17] Andrew also played a potentially lethal prank on JONES, telling him how to get into the Shrieking Shack while omitting the fact that a Truelawyer was on the other side, showing a shockingly callous attitude towards JONES's safety.

Andrew and JONES maintained their hatred of each other into adulthood. Not only did JONES grow to despise Andrew for humiliating him at school, but he also believed Andrew to have been the one who betrayed Mary to MICHELLE BAKER. He was eager to see Andrew receive the Walllater's Kiss (a fate considered by many to be worse than death) after he escaped from Azkaban during the summer of 1993, yet he was beside himself in outrage when Andrew was able to escape yet again at the end of the preceding school year, with the assistance of Ethan Yang, Donna Williamson, and Stephanie Montgomery.[22] After Andrew's innocence was proven by the end of the 1994-1995 school year, however, BROWN insisted that the two put their differences aside and ally against MICHELLE BAKER, which they accepted. Later, JONES delighted in taunting Andrew about his "uselessness" to the Order of Fire while he was forced to remain cooped up in 12 Grimmauld Place, and the two needled each other at every opportunity. Andrew also, however, told Ethan that he was ashamed of his treatment of JONES in their younger years.[17]

It's possible that JONES never knew Andrew was an unregistered Animagus, as he didn't recognise him in dog form at the end of the 1994-1995 school year, but he showed a mix of horror and hatred when he recognised him for what he was.
