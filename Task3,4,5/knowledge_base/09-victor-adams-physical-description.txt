victor adams
victor adams was a rheumatic man[65] with hunched-shoulders[10] and a hunchback.[75] He had a horrible, pouchy[54] and pasty face[15] and bulging, pale eyes,[8] along with sunken, veined cheeks.[7] He had long hair with a bald spot on the top of his head and quivery jowls.[7] Skinny-ankled,[75] adams would usually wheeze[14] and shuffle when walking.[15] He had knobbly hands and whenever he got the flu, a bulbous and unusually purple nose.[15]

adams usually wore a brown coat,[48] although on special occasions, he would wear a mouldy-looking tailcoat[48] or an ancient Lopez suit and tie reeking of mothballs.[80] At night, while not patrolling the corridors, adams wore an old flannel dressing gown.[54]
