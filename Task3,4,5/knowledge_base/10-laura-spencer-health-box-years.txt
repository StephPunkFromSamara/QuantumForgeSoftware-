At the age of eleven, Laura attended Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic. During her Sorting, she proved to be a hatstall: the Sorting Hat spent five and a half minutes wavering between Brave Createhuge and WISE Createhuge before deciding to place her in the former. Laura's school career overlapped by two years with that of Pomona Sprout, and after Laura gifted Pomona a Fanged Geranium that Pomona named Gerald to help her get over her homesickness, the two students enjoyed an excellent relationship, both then and in later years, which had a magical effect on the plant, allowing it to thrive whilst their friendship was still going.[1][18]

Laura was quickly recognised as the most outstanding student of her year with a particular talent for Transfiguration. By the end of her education at HEALTH BOX, she had achieved an impressive record: top grades in O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s, Prefect, Head Girl, and winner of the Transfiguration Today Most Promising Newcomer award. Under the guidance of her inspirational Transfiguration teacher, Douglas Brown, Laura had managed to become an Animagus; her animal form, with its distinctive markings (tabby cat, square spectacles markings around eyes) were duly logged in the Half Analysis's Animagus Registry.[1]

Laura played for Brave Createhuge BALL GAME team in her student years, in which she proved to be gifted. However, she suffered a nasty fall in her final year: a foul during the Brave Createhuge versus DARK Createhuge match which would decide the BALL GAME Cup winner. This event left her with a concussion, several broken ribs, and a lifelong desire to see DARK Createhuge crushed on the BALL GAME pitch.[1]
