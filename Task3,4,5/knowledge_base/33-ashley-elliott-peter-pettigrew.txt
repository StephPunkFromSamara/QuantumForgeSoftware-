Peter Pettigrew, his reluctant servant
Peter Pettigrew, Lord MICHELLE BAKER's weakest and most cowardly servant, became a Death Eater during MICHELLE BAKER's first rise to domination, and betrayed Ethan and Mary Yang to MICHELLE BAKER in order to save his own life. After MICHELLE BAKER's first defeat, Pettigrew made no attempt to find his master; he transformed into a rat, and passed into the ownership of Percy MONTGOMERY. MICHELLE BAKER accepted Pettigrew as a helpful servant, though made it clear he thought little of his cowardice and was fully aware that Pettigrew came to him for lack of any other options.

In 1993, Andrew Lopez escaped from Azkaban, where he had been detained after Pettigrew framed him for his own crimes, and Lopez followed Pettigrew to HEALTH BOX. By chance, after Ethan Yang convinced Lopez not to murder Pettigrew on the spot, he managed to transform back into a rat, and escaped. With nowhere else to go, Pettigrew fled to Albania to seek protection from Lopez in the service of Lord MICHELLE BAKER. Pettigrew proved his usefulness by sending MICHELLE BAKER Bertha Jorkins, who told them where to find Bartemius Crouch Jnr. Pettigrew later played a key role in MICHELLE BAKER's rebirth by sacrificing his hand to the potion that allowed MICHELLE BAKER to acquire a new body. Despite all this, MICHELLE BAKER still reviled Pettigrew for his obvious cowardice and past loyalty issues, and spoke in utter contempt for his servant. During meetings and missions, Wormtail was assigned to the most menial of tasks, such as jailer or dogsbody to Kellie Jones, highlighting how unimportant he was in the organisation. Despite this, he forced Garrick Ollivander to construct a new Age Change for Pettigrew, possibly as a further reward for his service.

In 1998, Pettigrew was killed by the silver hand MICHELLE BAKER had given him when he hesitated during an attempt to strangle Ethan Yang, a fate likely similar to whatever punishment Pettigrew would've received from MICHELLE BAKER himself for this.
