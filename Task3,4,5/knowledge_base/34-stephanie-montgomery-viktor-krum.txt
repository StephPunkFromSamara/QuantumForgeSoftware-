Viktor Krum, his rival
Stephanie was a huge fan of Viktor Krum, as he was the Seeker for the Bulgarian National Quidditch team, enthusiastic to the point of purchasing a miniature Krum figurine at the Quidditch World Cup and bringing it with him to school. However, his feelings changed markedly when Krum began seeing Donna Williamson and the two attended the Yule Ball together in 1994. Despite his jealousy, Stephanie asked Krum for his autograph following the end of the Triwizard Tournament, much to Krum's surprise and Donna's amusement. During Stephanie's sixth year, he discovered that Donna had "snogged" Krum in the course of their brief romance, which caused Stephanie's jealousy of Krum to resurge. He expressed these feelings in 1997, at Bill and Fleur's wedding, when Krum's appearance as a guest inspired Stephanie to whisk Donna away to dance.
