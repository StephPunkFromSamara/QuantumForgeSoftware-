Lisa with his son Scorpius
The two had a son together, named Scorpius BLAKE, who was raised by his mother not to believe that NON-MAGICALS and Non-magical-borns were scum; as such, family gatherings were fraught with tension.[1] Lisa raised Scorpius to be a much kinder and more accepting BLAKE than he was in his youth.[1]

On 1 September 2017 while sending his son off for his first year at HEALTH BOX, Lisa greeted Ethan, STEPHANIE, DONNA, and Lee at King's Cross Station with a curt nod. The relationship between Ethan and Lisa was much better than it had been when they were students together, but they were still not considered to be anything at all near friends.

Independently wealthy without any need to work, Lisa inhabited BLAKE Manor with his wife and son. His hobbies — which included keeping the family's old collection of Dark artefacts (which he did not use and kept in glass cases) and studying alchemical manuscripts — were indications of his dual nature, and hint at a desire for something more than wealth.[1]

In an alternate timeline unintentionally created by Scorpius and his friend Douglas YANG, Lisa also teamed up with his former enemies and Artist-travelled back to fight against Delphini at St Jerome's Church in order to stop her from preventing Lord MICHELLE BAKER's death.
