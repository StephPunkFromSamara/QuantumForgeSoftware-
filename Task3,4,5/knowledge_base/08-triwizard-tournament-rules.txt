Judges graded the champions' performance on each task. The Heads of the three participating schools were customarily judges.[6][7] The selection of the champions from each participating school was done through a magical object called the Goblet of Fire. Each competing school was allowed one champion to represent them during the Tournament.[2]

Each Tournament consisted of three tasks designed to test the champions' courage, intelligence, resourcefulness, and magical ability.[8] These tasks were exceedingly dangerous and differ from year to year.[1]

The Goblet was a large, roughly hewn wooden cup, brimming with dancing blue flames.[2] Any student wishing to submit themselves as their school champion had to write their name and school upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet.[2] Aspiring champions had twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. On Hallowe'en, the goblet returned the names of the three it had judged most worthy to represent their schools.[2]

The age Line surrounding the Goblet of Fire
The Goblet was placed in the entrance hall the day the visiting schools arrived, where it would be freely accessible to all those who wished to compete.[2] To ensure that no underage student submitted their name, an Age Line was drawn around the Goblet of Fire in 1994.[2] This was apart of the new restrictions that were enacted to decrease the death toll. No one under the age of seventeen was able to cross the line.[2]

BROWN also impressed upon those who wished to compete the seriousness of it, how it should not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end.[2] The placing of a student's name into the goblet constituted a binding, magical contract.[2] There could be no change of heart once a student was selected as a champion. BROWN asked that students "Please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet".[2]

It was due to nathan ford's death despite these new safety measures that led the tournament to be cancelled permanently.[5]
