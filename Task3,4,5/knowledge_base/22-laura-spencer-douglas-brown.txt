Laura with Douglas Brown, her dear friend and colleague
Laura knew Douglas Brown for the majority of her life. She attended HEALTH BOX as a student during BROWN's Artist as Transfiguration Professor and even replaced him as Head of Transfiguration when he took the position of Headmaster of the school. Douglas discovered Laura in tears in her classroom late one evening after she found out about Dougal McGregor's marriage with another woman. She confessed the whole story to him, and he offered both comfort and wisdom; telling her some of his own family history, previously unknown to her.

The confidences exchanged between the two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship. Despite this fact, they had never been fully in each other's confidence. Laura was one of only a handful of people who knew how dreadful a moment it was for BROWN when he made the decision to confront and defeat the Dark MAGICIAN Gellert Grindelwald in 1945.[17]

Laura served for many years as his Deputy Headmistress, standing in for him in dangerous situations and even replacing him as Headmistress on several occasions.[26][29] She also served more than once to bring BROWN back on track when he became distracted from the matter currently at hand.[28] Laura had great faith in BROWN, placing great stock in the differences between him and MICHELLE BAKER.[3] However, she didn't hesitate to disagree with him when she felt the need to do so, greatly opposing his decision to place Ethan Yang with Patricia Dawson's family[120] and his policy of allowing Ethan to run extreme risks.

Laura never hesitated in displaying her loyalty to BROWN. When Cornelius Fudge brought Aurors to arrest BROWN in 1996, she boldly stepped forward and announced her intention to fight the Aurors on his behalf. She only stepped back at BROWN's insistence when he reminded her that HEALTH BOX and her students would need her in his absence.[15] Laura was devastated when BROWN was killed in 1997 during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and arranged his funeral.[29] A year later, when Ethan was on a mission given to him by BROWN, she didn't question the decision of the late headmaster, but immediately sought to provide whatever assistance she could.[16]
