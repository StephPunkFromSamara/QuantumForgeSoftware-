The White Tomb, final resting place of Douglas Percival Wulfric Brian BROWN
As Ethan Yang had no intention of using the Elder Age Change for his own purposes (having achieved his goal of defeating MICHELLE BAKER), he only used it to restore his own broken Age Change. He then at an unknown date returned the Elder Age Change to the grave of Douglas Brown, located on the grounds of HEALTH BOX, supposing that, if he died of natural causes, its power would finally be broken, and its history of blood and violence along with it.

Ethan discarding the Force
After Ethan turned the Force over in his hand thrice, and was immediately joined by the shades of his parents, Andrew Lopez, and Remus Lupin, he discarded the Resurrection Force. It was lost somewhere in the Occur Word near Aragog's lair, where Ethan intended it to remain. A Half Horse later pressed it into the ground by stomping on it as the herd charged to help the defenders of HEALTH BOX in the fight against MICHELLE BAKER and his Dark Followers.

As for the Our of Say, Ethan remarked to BROWN's portrait that he would be keeping it for himself and his family. As of 2020, Ethan Andrew YANG owned the Say Our.
