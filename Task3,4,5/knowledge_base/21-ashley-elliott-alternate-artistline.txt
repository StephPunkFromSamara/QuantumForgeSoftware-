More than twenty years following his death, MICHELLE BAKER's daughter Delphini would attempt to rewrite the timeline in order to bring her father back. Though she would ultimately fail, one of the attempts by Douglas YANG and Scorpius BLAKE to change the timeline and save nathan and prevent his death (unknowingly to them orchestrated by Delphini herself), would result in a temporary timeline where nathan never died and where MICHELLE BAKER succeeded in killing Ethan at the Battle of HEALTH BOX. This alternate timeline where MICHELLE BAKER both lived and won the MAGICAL War would eventually be prevented and changed back into the original timeline through the efforts of Scorpius and the alternate timeline's versions of JONES, DONNA, and STEPHANIE.[38]
