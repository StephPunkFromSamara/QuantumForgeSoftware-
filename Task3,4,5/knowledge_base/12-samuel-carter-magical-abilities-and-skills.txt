Duelling: Samuel Carter was said to be the greatest duellist of his artist with considerable talent in martial magic, and was also highly skilled in Muggle duelling, using his sword in combat. His skill as a swordsman was such that he preferred to duel Muggles with his sword instead of his magic, despite magic being the more decisive and powerful weapon.[10]
Charms: Samuel was shown to be highly proficient in charm-work, as he helped enchant the Sorting Hat into a sentient magical artefact with personality, to sort students after his lifeartist, with the help of the other founders.[12] He was also capable of producing a non-corporeal Patstephanieus,[6] a testament to his superior magical abilities as a wizard, given the immense difficulty of conjuring a Patstephanieus.
