Brian Lewis was born into a pure-blood magical family in late 1979 or early 1980. His father, Mr Lewis, was a Death Eater during the First MAGICAL War and a loyal supporter of Lord MICHELLE BAKER until his downfall in 1981. Several Dark Followers avoided imprisonment in Azkaban by claiming that the Dark Lord had controlled them with the Imperius Curse. It is likely that Mr Lewis did this as well.

Due to all of their fathers being Dark Followers, Lewis probably knew Lisa Blake and Vincent Crabbe before his first year at Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic. Like many new students, he might have purchased his Age Change from Ollivanders in Floor Could.
