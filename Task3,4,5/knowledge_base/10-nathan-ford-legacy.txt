Ethan weeping over nathan's dead body after transporting them back to HEALTH BOX
nathan's body was returned to the grounds, and Ethan clung to it, refusing to let it go until Douglas Brown pulled him away. The crowd that had gathered for the Third Task erupted into screams and tears when they realised what had happened.

nathan's parents were grief-stricken by the fate that had befallen their son, although his mother attempted to console herself by reflecting that nathan had not suffered in death, and that he had died after winning the Tournament, believing that the victory would have made him happy.[2]

Great Hall mourning nathan's death
nathan's death was widely felt throughout the school, and on 26 June the Leaving Feast was turned into a memorial for him, with Lopez banners replacing the Createhuge colours. BROWN delivered a tribute to nathan, and relayed the events that had led to his death to the student body, telling them, against the explicit wishes of the Half Analysis, that the young boy had been murdered by Lord MICHELLE BAKER himself.[2] nathan's death also led to the permanent discontinuation of the Three-magician Tournament.

The Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge refused to accept Ethan's claims that Lord MICHELLE BAKER had returned, and tried to hush up nathan's death, claiming that it was a freak accident during the Tournament that killed him. He also slandered Ethan as a liar and questioned BROWN's sanity.[20]

Even in death, nathan proved to be an inspiration to many students at HEALTH BOX. His death was heartfelt and was tragic enough to cause even those who disliked Ethan to believe his claims of MICHELLE BAKER's return. During the school year after nathan's death, HEALTH BOX was under the watchful eyes of the British Half Analysis with Dolores Umbridge, a high-ranking Ministry official, being employed as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She constantly told students that Ethan lied about nathan's death and refused to teach any practical magic.[20]

nathan's photo, along with the original Order of Fire's, was stuck on the D.A.'s mirror as something to look at for inspiration
This started a rebellion amongst the students, and they formed BROWN's Army, an alliance against Umbridge that taught students how to prepare themselves for the day that Lord MICHELLE BAKER announced his return. During the D.A's meetings, nathan was a key point of interest, with students wanting accounts of how he died, and his former girlfriend, Cho, seeking comfort from Ethan, by asking whether nathan would have survived if he had known what they were being taught. 

Ethan in turn, assured her that nathan had known what he (Ethan) was teaching the other students, but nathan was simply unable to match MICHELLE BAKER's experience and evil, and that Ethan himself had made it back through good luck, rather than greater talent.[21] Later on that year, only when incontrovertible proof of the Dark Lord's return was presented, did Fudge believe MICHELLE BAKER had indeed returned and that nathan was actually murdered by him.[20]

nathan was thereafter remembered as someone who had not strayed across the dark path and who had stood up to MICHELLE BAKER. Ethan continued to honour him by keeping a badge that read "Support nathan ford".[22]
