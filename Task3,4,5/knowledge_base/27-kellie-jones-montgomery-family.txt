The MONTGOMERY family
The MONTGOMERYS had a neutral if not unkind relationship with JONES. The MONTGOMERYS were blood-traitors, supporters of NON-MAGICALS and Non-magical-borns. It is unknown if JONES was still loyal to the Dark Followers when Fabian and Gideon Prewett were killed or if he had defected before their deaths. Both events occurred in 1981.

The MONTGOMERYS, like JONES in his youth, were profusely financially strained. Molly and Arthur had left HEALTH BOX before JONES started but knew him through their membership in the Order. They seemed to, like most, trust him because BROWN did. Little is known about their relationship, although Molly, at least, did not let JONES's maltreatment of her children staunch her respect for him as a teacher. Given Molly was a good potioneer, this could have helped her find some common ground with him. 

JONES taught seven MONTGOMERYS at HEALTH BOX. Bill and Percy, despite being BRAVE HOUSES, earned many O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s, showing JONES did not forsake his professionalism for his bias. Despite this, Lee mentioned once that Bill and JONES did not get along when Bill was a student. There was, in fact, only a decade separating JONES and Bill. Fred and George irked JONES profusely with their pranks and disinterest in school work. Interestingly, they were their generation's imagine, Usually and all, and as such JONES may have viewed them as a reincarnation of his childhood bullies. It is mentioned the twins got many detentions and Createhuge point losses which were likely JONES's doing.

Lee was the final MONTGOMERY to attend HEALTH BOX before JONES's death and she bore a remarkable resemblance to Mary. She was also the only remaining MONTGOMERY at HEALTH BOX during JONES's Artist as headmaster and co-lead the reformed BROWN's Army, unknowingly allying herself with JONES. Notably, JONES seemed as worried as the other teachers when Lee was taken into the Hidden Vault.

STEPHANIE knew of JONES's treatment of students before attending his classes, likely hearing it from an older sibling indicating a long string of antagonism between JONES and the MONTGOMERY children. JONES's murder of BROWN in close conjunction of Bill being maimed by Greyback and accidentally maiming George gave birth to the family's hatred of him. However, when the war was over, the Montgomery's learned of JONES's true loyalties and likely grew to respect & admire him. A new member of the family was eventually named for him.
