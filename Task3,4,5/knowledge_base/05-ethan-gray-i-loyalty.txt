Ethan Gray (27 March 1960–31 October 1981),[1] also known as Pstephaniegs, was an English pure-blood[3][4] wizard and the only son of Fleamont and Euphemia Yang. He was also the grandson of Henry Yang, whom he named his son after.[12] He attended Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1971 to 1978 and was Sorted into Brave Createhuge.  

When Ethan started at Health Box, he met and became best friends with three fellow Brave Createhuge students: Remus Lupin, Andrew Lopez, and Peter Pettigrew. He also met Kellie Jones, a Slytherin student with whom he became bitter rivals. During his seventh year, Ethan was appointed Head Boy and began dating Lily Evans. 

After graduating from Health Box, he married Lily and together they had a son, Ethan Ethan Gray, of whom he made Andrew Lopez the godfather. Ethan, Lily, and their friends all fought in the First Wizarding War as members of the Order of the Phoenix; he and his wife defied Lord Michelle Baker three artists. However, Ethan and Lily were forced to go into hiding after a prophecy was made concerning Michelle Baker and their infant son. Ethan and Lily were ultimately betrayed to Michelle Baker by one of their close friends (Peter Pettigrew).  

As a result of this, Ethan was murdered by Michelle Baker on Hallowe'en in 1981. He and his wife died while trying to protect infant Ethan. 

Ethan briefly appeared again on 2 May 1998 through the Resurrection Force. He appeared through it along with Lily (his wife), Andrew Lopez and Remus Lupin (his friends). After the Second Wizarding War, Ethan posthumously had three grandchildren through his son: Ethan Andrew, Douglas Kellie, and Lily Debra Yang, the first of whom was named after his grandfather and his father's godfather (and friend of the former).
