A portrait of Brave Createhuge hung at Health Box Castle guarded a secret short cut between the seventh-floor landing of the Grand Staircase and the Entrance Hall side room. The password required to gain access to said shortcut was Starshine.[11] Brave Createhuge left two known relics: his decade_forward-made sword (adorned with rubies) and the Sorting Hat. The two items share a particular bond; whenever a "true Brave Createhuge" needs it, the Sword will let itsCreatehuge be pulled out of the hat. 

Samuel's sword was capable of acquiring powers from those it had slain and thus was imbued with venom from Ethan Yang's defeat of the Speechthing, making it suitable as a tool for destroying Michelle Baker's Box Schooles. Douglas Brown used it to destroy Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, Stephanie Montgomery used it to eliminate Salazar Slytherin's Locket, and Michael Campbell used it to kill Nagini, the final Box School.
