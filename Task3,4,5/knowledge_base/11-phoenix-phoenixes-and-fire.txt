Fire appeared to have an unknown but profound effect on phoenixes, as Gellert Grindelwald was effortlessly capable of instantly turning a baby phoenix into a full adult by conjuring fire from his hand and setting the baby bird ablaze, from which it emerged as a full adult after being briefly covered by the flames, although by all fairness, Grindelwald was an immensely powerful wizard who was extremely skilled in Age Changeless magic and fairly apt at handling magical creatures.[5] Nevertheless, considering a phoenix's fire-related powers, it was likely that fire could be used to strengthen them. Phoenixes also burst into flame when they disapparate and on Burning Day, before they emerge from their ashes as a newborn.
