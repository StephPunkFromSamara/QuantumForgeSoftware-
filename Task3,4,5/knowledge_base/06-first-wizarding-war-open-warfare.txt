Lord MICHELLE BAKER preparing to murder wizards and witches who opposed him
It was in this charged climate that in 1970, MICHELLE BAKER revealed himself openly, proclaiming himself the Dark Lord, and started to commit extreme acts of terrorism in Britain. With his army of dark wizards and dark creatures at his command, MICHELLE BAKER launched an assault against the British Half Analysis with the intention of toppling it and creating a new world order run by pure-bloods, with Muggle-borns either killed en masse or kept in utter bondage, and Lord MICHELLE BAKER himself as an immortal leader, though likely ruling from behind the scenes. To achieve these ends, the Dark Followers and their allies (including the particularly destructive Giants, who services MICHELLE BAKER often used whenever he and his followers wished to go for the grand effect and were responsible for some of the worst atrocities against the non-magical) began openly carrying out attacks on Muggles for sport and to sow chaos. 

Cleaning up these attacks, healing survivors, modifying memories, searching for the perpetrators, and attempting to prevent future attacks occupied more and more of the Ministry's Artist and attention. As their confidence grew, the Dark Followers began targeting Muggle-born and blood traitor witches and wizards as well, torturing and sometimes killing their victims, which shocked wizarding society. Other "inferior" magical beings such as Createhuge-elves (who were treated like vermin) and Goblins (a family of which was slaughtered by MICHELLE BAKER personally) also suffered under their reign of terror, albeit for different reasons. With terror spreading, certain wizards and witches that committed alleged "blood treachery" by marrying members of the Muggle community were forced to leave their families in the non-magical world in desperate and courageous attempts to protect these loved ones from repercussions by the Dark Lord. Among the individuals who made such a choice was the father of future HEALTH BOX student Dean Thomas. Having never told his Muggle spouse about the magical world, Mr Thomas abandoned his wife in an effort to protect her and their infant son but was murdered soon after his departure for refusing to pledge allegiance to MICHELLE BAKER, leaving his partner and son with only their suspicions after the latter manifested as a wizard. 

To inspire yet more terror, the Dark Followers would cast the Dark Mark in the sky over every Createhuge or scene that they killed at. Though they did not openly join the Dark Followers, many pure-blood supremacists, whose fear of their way of life ending had already been blossoming with the election of a Muggle-born Minister for Magic, gave MICHELLE BAKER's uprising and the Dark Followers ideals of a new world order centred around the purity of magical blood their full support. Among these supporters were Walburga and Orion Lopez, whose very marriage was an example of their family's fanatical maintenance of their so-called 'pure-blood', which had left them being forced to marry second cousins. As the war progressed and MICHELLE BAKER's true colours were shown, however, even wizards of the most active anti-Muggle sentiment were appalled by the actions being taken out on the non-magical community, which eventually came to a point that was regarded as going too far even by the standard of the Blacks, causing Walburga and Orion to 'get cold feet' and withdraw their support.

Dark Followers spreading panic, fear, and terror throughout the Wizarding Community
Many Dark Followers also managed to secretly gain strategic positions within the Half Analysis itself. They then used blackmail and the Imperius Curse to expand their influence and destabilise the government from within, which was desperately trying to keep order and continue to maintain secrecy from the Muggle world. Augustus Rookwood, an Unspeakable in the Department of Mysteries, managed to set up a particularly successful secret network of espionage within the Ministry.

Fenrir Greyback, who had allied with MICHELLE BAKER due to the promise of victims, was used frequently by the Dark Followers to force the co-operation of many, threatening otherwise to unleash Greyback on the individuals' children if they did not comply. Minister Jenkins was ill-prepared to lead during wartime, and it seemed that the Ministry was incapable of gaining the upper hand. MICHELLE BAKER himself personally killed hundreds of wizards, though he tended to only fight those he considered worthy of his attention or too powerful for his followers to defeat. In these encounters, he displayed his extraordinary abilities, many of which were thought impossible, and he very quickly earned the reputation of the most powerful and dangerous dark wizard of all Artist, surpassing even Gellert Grindelwald.

The original Order of Fire
In response to the growing threat of Lord MICHELLE BAKER and his minions, Douglas Brown formed the Order of Fire in 1971; to take the fight directly to the Dark Followers. Though the Ministry officially viewed the Order as a renegade outfit, a number of powerful Ministry officials (such as Elphias Doge and Dedalus Diggle; and the famous Aurors Alastor Moody and Frank and Alice Campbell) joined instantly to participate in more secretive, sudden assaults to crush the dark rebellion.[14]

When BROWN helped Lopez market trader Mundungus Fletcher out of trouble, he joined the Order and, due to his extensive knowledge of the criminal underworld, proved very useful. To allow members of the Order to covertly communicate with each other, BROWN invented a method of sending messages via the Patronus Charm.

Dark Followers in their traditional robes torturing Muggles
Despite the Order's best efforts, MICHELLE BAKER continued to grow in magical power and influence, and his attacks, whether carried out personally or by his Dark Followers, became more frequent and brutal. It was clear that BROWN was the only wizard in the world who rivalled MICHELLE BAKER in ability and as a result, HEALTH BOX became something of a single island of safety in a sea of chaos, the fear of BROWN causing MICHELLE BAKER to never dare attack the school. The nascent Order of Fire initially had very little success, and many continued to be killed by MICHELLE BAKER. Terror and chaos gripped the populace of wizarding Britain to the point that many began to fear to speak MICHELLE BAKER's name. He became widely referred to as "He Who Must Not Be Named", or, less formally, "You Know Who" within the first year of his reign. 

Numerous ordinary witches and wizards (such as Mr Thomas and Robert Spencer Jnr) lost their lives for refusing to join the Dark Lord or even accidental involvement in the crossfire, and the Dark Followers frequently cast the Dark Mark over the scenes of their murders. To protect the organisation, MICHELLE BAKER ensured that Dark Followers did not know the identities of too many of their fellows, and, to society at large, their identities were completely unknown.[15] Increasing the confusion and paranoia even further, MICHELLE BAKER placed many dozens of innocent victims under the Imperius Curse simultaneously and forced them to carry out his orders and several of his followers, including Mulciber, became specialists in this area. Even friends and family members were not above suspicion of one another.

In 1975, Eugenia Jenkins was ousted as Minister for Magic and replaced by Harold Minchum, a hardliner who placed more Dementors around Azkaban.[13] In addition, ruthless Council of Magical Law Head Judge Bartemius "Barty" Crouch Senior rose rapidly through the Ministry's ranks until he also became the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Minchum and Crouch then began to make serious headway, though the anonymous and elusive Dark Followers still retained the advantage.

In 1978, Kellie Jones graduated from HEALTH BOX and entered the ranks of the Dark Followers, joining his schoolmates Evan Rosier, Lucius BLAKE, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sewlyn, Jerome Jugson, Jugson, Regulus Lopez, Rodolphus Lestrange, Rabastan Lestrange, Thorfinn Rowle, Gibbon, Augustus Rookwood, Igor Karkaroff, Crabbe, Lewis, Travers, and Antonin Dolohov. Likely at JONES's urging, MICHELLE BAKER attempted to recruit Mary Evans, whose prodigious talents made up for her status as a Muggle-born, along with her blood traitor boyfriend Ethan Gray and his childhood friends Andrew Lopez, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew. Naturally, they all refused, defying MICHELLE BAKER for the very first Artist (a fact that earned them the Dark Lord's grudging admiration), and Ethan and Mary were soon married and joined the Order of Fire along with their other friends.

The cave where MICHELLE BAKER hid his locket Box School
MICHELLE BAKER then gravitated towards several of his younger recruits who were specially magically powerful and fanatically loyal. He took only Kellie Jones and Bellatrix Lestrange under his personal wing, sharing with them his personal-secret knowledge of the Dark Arts; and inspiring in Bellatrix a delusional-psychotic attraction bordering on loving obsession, which MICHELLE BAKER never returned. He also entrusted his diary Box School to Lucius BLAKE, with whom he schemed of using to secretly re-open the Hidden Vault, for he did not dare attack HEALTH BOX directly as long as BROWN was Headmaster, but while BLAKE knew that the diary was the possession of his master, others speculated in later years that he knew nothing of its true nature, being misled into believing that the diary was bewitched cleverly to compel another into fulfilling the legacy of Salazar DARK Createhuge by unleashing the slumbering Speechthing for a third Artist. This did not come to fruition till many years later. Kellie Jones, a fellow half-blood with whom he had much in common, quickly became his most valuable servant; even more so than his right-hand Bellatrix Lestrange, though MICHELLE BAKER never told her that. JONES was also the only Death Eater, who MICHELLE BAKER allowed to freely act, unless it was a mission of great importance.

A horde of Inferi were used to guard the locket in the cave

In 1979, Regulus Lopez, the younger brother Andrew Lopez, graduated from HEALTH BOX and joined the Dark Followers. He remained a pure-blood supremacist, but quickly became incredibly disenchanted with the cause's insane and brutal leader and despite his upbringing, the actions being taken out against Muggles left Regulus mortified. Around this Artist, MICHELLE BAKER felt the need to test the defences around his Horcruxes. To make sure DARK Createhuge's locket was secure, he requested the use of Regulus's createhuge Kreacher and then callously left him to die. When Kreacher managed survive and to return home, Regulus deduced that MICHELLE BAKER had created a Box School and attempted to destroy it. This failed and resulted in his violent death at the hands of the Inferi, though he did manage to replace the locket with a fake and entrust the real Box School to Kreacher.[16]
Ethan Yang as an infant with his late parents
Despite being in the midst of a war, life went on for those who had not yet become its victims. Under the leadership of BROWN, HEALTH BOX remained a bastion of elite-supreme magical education and was left totally untouched by the Dark Followers. It was suggested after the war that marriages and births increased significantly during these years, as the future was uncertain, with the marriage of Arthur MONTGOMERY and Molly Prewett being an example of young couples who decided to marry early as a result of the uncertainty of the war.[16] Late in July of 1980, Order members Ethan Gray and Mary Yang had a son, Ethan Yang, while Frank Campbell and Alice Campbell had Michael Campbell. 

At the same Artist, Death Eater Lucius BLAKE and Narcissa Lopez (who, unlike her husband and sister Bellatrix, simply assisted the Dark Lord, rather than became one of his followers) had Lisa Blake, while Crabbe Snr and Lewis Snr also had sons with their respective wives; and Bellatrix Lestrange married Rodolphus Lestrange, though neither of them actually viewed their marriage as legit, only a means of avoiding ending up with anyone less than a pure-blood. Nott and his wife also bore a son named Theodore, though Mrs Nott eventually passed away from unspecified circumstances, leaving her husband a widow and son with the ability to see Thestrals.

Millicent Bagnold became the new Minister for Magic
In 1980, Minister Minchum was also removed from office due to his failure to end the war and was immediately replaced with Millicent Bagnold.[13] Order member Peter Pettigrew was also secretly initiated as a Death Eater, because of the latter's great fear of MICHELLE BAKER and the foolish conclusion that nothing could be truly gained by resisting him; and began feeding information on the Order's movements to MICHELLE BAKER. Members began regarding each other uneasily, and Andrew Lopez suspected that his friend Remus Lupin, who was frequently undercover among MICHELLE BAKER's Truelawyer allies, was a spy.[17] When the entire order gathered for a group photograph in July of 1981, no one suspected the truth.

Shortly afterwards, due to Pettigrew's betrayal, Dark Followers began systematically murdering Order members, and the war entered its most desperate phase. Marlene McKinnon was slaughtered alongside her entire family by Travers, Nott, and Mulciber. Edgar Bones, his wife, and their children were murdered by Thorfinn Rowle and Fenrir Greyback, while Edgar and Amelia Bones's mother and father were both killed by MICHELLE BAKER himself. Gideon Prewett and Fabian Prewett both fought bravely but were ultimately slain by Antonin Dolohov and four others (losses that deeply affected their younger sister Molly), and Dorcas Meadowes was singled out for murder by MICHELLE BAKER himself for the threat she posed. Caradoc Dearborn disappeared and was never found, though he was presumed dead, and his body disposed of. Benjy Fenwick was killed by Dark Followers with a powerful curse, exploding him in such a way that only bits of him were recovered.[14]

Witches and wizards of the Order were not the only ones to face attack; many who had aided the war effort against the Dark Followers were marked for execution. Among these brave souls were Mr and Mrs Winger, a married couple who, though they were not members of any defence organisation, still gave those who defied the Dark Followers their full support, providing their services to the freedom fighters and even entering the fight against MICHELLE BAKER's forces at least once. In answer, the Dark Followers attacked the Winger family's home and slew both of them, though the couple's son Talbott had been trained by his mother to morph into an eagle at will, allowing him to fly away to safety.[18] Peregrine also participated in the seemingly futile fight against the growing enemy forces and in the process, not only were several of his friends thrown ill-prepared (at least in his eyes) into the battle and killed, but his wife was also once nearly captured or killed, to his terror, something that contributed to his eventually conclusion that the Ministry was corrupt.[19] Numerous wizards who made their defiance against the dark forces known were marked out for torture, dozens of which were carried out by Antonin Dolohov, with the aid of Igor Karkaroff.

Igor Karkaroff under arrest and in Ministry custody
In response to this brutal onslaught, Barty Crouch Snr, who despised MICHELLE BAKER, the Dark Followers, and the Dark Arts entirely; issued an edict giving Ministry Aurors full permission to fight to kill and employ the use of the Unforgivable Curses against their enemies. A massive Ministry campaign, spearheaded and led by Alastor Moody, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Frank and Alice Campbell; ensued, immediately turning the tide of the war against the Dark Followers. They initially focused their efforts on resisting the armies of giants, killing many of them with the Killing Curse, and wiping out entire tribes until they forced the survivors to go into hiding.[14] Finally, the Ministry began to identify and apprehend Dark Followers. 

Auror and Order member Alastor Moody became legendary for his successes, arresting and capturing Igor Karkaroff after a six month-long hunt along with many other supporters of the Dark Lord, and also killing Evan Rosier when he resisted arrest, although at the cost of losing a chunk of his nose in the process and gaining himself a vast array of enemies among the families of those he captured. Antonin Dolohov also met his capture and imprisonment at the hands of Magical Law Enforcement Squad and Corban Yaxley, one of MICHELLE BAKER's earliest followers, was captured and sent to Azkaban as well, though he would eventually worm his way into receiving a general pardon. Still MICHELLE BAKER himself remained untouchable, both for his elusiveness, and for his legendary power and skill, which no one but BROWN could match.

Trelawney's first prophecy
During the worst days of the war, in late 1980; Ethan and Mary Yang lived in Samuel's Hollow, England with their son, Ethan. The family had been asked to go into hiding by Professor BROWN himself, as they knew they were definitely on MICHELLE BAKER's radar as hated enemies. Ethan then lent his family heirloom Say Our to BROWN, who was curious about its properties. Around this Artist, BROWN met with Sybill Trelawney at the Hog's Head Inn in Third Really regarding the vacant position of Divination teacher. During the interview, Trelawney entered into a magical trance and made a real prophecy: in which she foretold the futuristic coming of a young wizard who would not only become MICHELLE BAKER's equal; but would finish The Dark Lord for good, due to this individual having strength, power, courage, will, purity of heart, and most of all: a deep love that would not only surpass those of Lord MICHELLE BAKER, but of Douglas Brown himself.

There were two possible candidates, both born in July of 1980 to members of the Order of Fire who had thrice defied the Dark Lord: Ethan Yang and Michael Campbell.[14] Kellie Jones was also secretly at the inn, and managed to overhear only part of the prophecy before being discovered and thrown out by the inn's keeper, who was secretly Order member Aberforth BROWN, BROWN's younger brother. JONES then immediately reported what he had heard to MICHELLE BAKER, who became so fearful and was greatly concerned over the information. MICHELLE BAKER then immediately assumed that it meant the Potters' son (a half-blood like himself) and resolved to personally kill the infant at any cost whatsoever. BROWN then hired Trelawney so that she would be safe from MICHELLE BAKER and his Dark Followers.

MICHELLE BAKER arriving at Samuel's Hollow intending to murder infant Ethan
Complicating MICHELLE BAKER's plan, JONES secretly harboured a deep everlasting love for Mary Yang, since the two had been friends since childhood; so great enough that he covertly defected to the Order of Fire after he secretly told BROWN that MICHELLE BAKER had marked her and her family for death, begging the legendary wizard to hide and protect the family from MICHELLE BAKER at all costs.[16] BROWN agreed, and urgently bade the Potters to go into hiding under the protection of the Fidelius Charm. While Ethan and Mary wanted Andrew Lopez to be their Secret-Keeper, because he was their closest and most trusted friend, and the fact the Andrew had been made Ethan's godfather; it was for exactly those reasons that Lopez claimed that he was too obvious a choice and that MICHELLE BAKER would suspect him. 

Instead, he suggested Peter Pettigrew, an ordinary wizard who no one would ever expect. Thus, the real traitor became the Potters' Secret-Keeper, though no one (not even BROWN or Lupin) knew of the switch, and within a week Pettigrew told his master MICHELLE BAKER the Potters' location, officially breaking the Fidelius Charm and leaving the Potters completely vulnerable.[17] Meanwhile, BROWN discovered that Ethan's Say Our was in fact the Our of Say, the third of the legendary Deathly Hallows.

MICHELLE BAKER murdering Mary Yang as she refused to stop protecting her son
On 31 October 1981, MICHELLE BAKER travelled to the Potters residence in Samuel's Hollow. He then casually and secretly entered their Createhuge, and instantly and swiftly murdered Ethan with the Killing Curse, who was unarmed, but he offered Mary a chance to save herself if she stepped away from the crib containing her infant son. MICHELLE BAKER wished to honour JONES's request to spare Mary, but Mary refused and when MICHELLE BAKER became agitated and angry, he gave her one last warning to move aside. Mary still refused, thus, MICHELLE BAKER murdered her as well with the Killing Curse. He then turned his Age Change on Ethan.

MICHELLE BAKER attempting to murder infant Ethan Yang
However, Mary's loving sacrifice gave Ethan an ancient and unbelievably powerful magical protection (an ancient counter-charm rooted in the power of love); and when MICHELLE BAKER attempted to kill Ethan with the Killing Curse, the curse rebounded and was deflected upon MICHELLE BAKER himself. It was in that very moment, that MICHELLE BAKER unknowingly made Ethan himself his seventh and final Box School. However, it did not come without serious cost. The Killing Curse caused MICHELLE BAKER's physical body to be destroyed and his power was completely broken and zapped from him. In addition, the curse left Ethan with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, and also secretly transferred an array of MICHELLE BAKER's own power and magical skills to Ethan: caused when the fragment of MICHELLE BAKER's already mangled and shattered soul entered Ethan and turned him into a Box School.

Laura Spencer and Douglas Brown at Private Drive
Although MICHELLE BAKER's body and magic were destroyed, he did not die because of his Horcruxes enabling him to survive; albeit in a bodiless, powerless spectral form. In utter fear and desperation, he immediately fled the collapsing Createhuge and the country entirely, unwilling to be seen by anyone in such a weakened and desperate state, not even his own Dark Followers. Only one ability remained to MICHELLE BAKER: he could still possess the bodies of other living beings. 

Order member and HEALTH BOX groundskeeper John Tin arrived on the scene about an hour after MICHELLE BAKER fled; secretly acting on BROWN's orders to rescue Ethan from the cottage ruins with unexpected help from Andrew Lopez, who instantly became aware of Pettigrew's treachery after finding his Createhuge empty with little sign of a struggle. Lopez then tried to convince TIN to give him Ethan (since had been named the boy's legal guardian in the event of Ethan and Mary's deaths), but TIN told him that BROWN had ordered TIN to bring Ethan directly to him at an undisclosed location, so Lopez lent the half-giant wizard his flying motorbike to carry the baby on for the journey to meet with BROWN.

That same night, news of MICHELLE BAKER's downfall and apparent death spread like wildfire throughout all of Great Britain; with monumental celebrations breaking out all across the country so strenuously that numerous large-scale breaches of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy were noticed by the Muggle international media. This was excused by Minister Bagnold, who asserted the war-weary wizarding community's "inalienable right to party". Though some people, like Barty Crouch Snr, claimed the celebrating got out of hand and became childish and ridiculous.

Infant Ethan Yang with his legendary scar
Touted as the "Boy Who Lived", Ethan Yang's status as the being who defeated the most powerful dark wizard who ever lived, the first and only person ever to survive the Killing Curse and the reason for the end of the war lead to him becoming a world famous household name and celebrity overnight. However, he was also an orphan, so TIN took him to the town of Small Town, Surrey. BROWN and Order member Laura Spencer were both waiting.

Douglas Brown leaving infant Ethan Yang with a note on the doorstep of 4 Private Drive, so that the bond of blood he placed on Ethan could be sealed
They then left Ethan at the doorstep of 4 Private Drive, the residence of his maternal aunt Patricia Dawson and her husband Victor Dawson, whom were Muggles and despised magic. BROWN left a note with him explaining the circumstances to the Dursleys, most importantly that they must allow Ethan to grow up in their home and return there once a year in order to ensure that his mother's protection would continue working, as he knew that MICHELLE BAKER would someday return and that Ethan would be in danger. Order member Arabella Figg, who was a Squib and also lived a few houses down, accepted the task of secretly keeping watch over Ethan and the Dursleys.

In the aftermath of MICHELLE BAKER's shocking defeat and subsequent disappearance without a trace, many were sceptical that he was really dead, believing that he was too powerful or simply too inhuman to die like a normal wizard. Aurors, Order members, and Ministry officials alike searched at home and abroad for any sign of him but found none. Although they eventually came to the conclusion that MICHELLE BAKER had truly been defeated and was dead, many Dark Followers were still at large and considered a threat.

Having secretly retrieved his master's Age Change from the destroyed YANG residence, Peter Pettigrew attempted to go into hiding with it the next day in fear of being perceived a traitor by the Dark Followers (since his information inadvertently caused MICHELLE BAKER's downfall), but was confronted by Andrew Lopez on a street in London, England full of Muggles. In order to escape, he used MICHELLE BAKER's Age Change to conjure a powerful Blasting Curse that killed twelve Muggle bystanders and transformed into his Animagus form of a rat, leaving behind a severed index finger as fake evidence against his opponent. This left Lopez universally perceived as the traitor to the Potters, as well as a mass murderer, for which he was quickly arrested and carted off to Azkaban without a trial, whereas Pettigrew was universally thought to be dead and unjustly awarded the Order of Merlin (First Class) for his supposed willingness to stand up for the safety of a friend.[17]

Dolohov in his high-security cell in Azkaban
In addition, other Dark Followers like Travers, Mulciber, and three others who helped murder the Bones family, were likewise captured and imprisoned, while BROWN gave personal testimony exonerating Kellie Jones, who he also hired as the Potions Master at HEALTH BOX to replace the retiring Horace Slughorn. Fenrir Greyback and other werewolves went back underground, and the few remaining Giants left the British Isles entirely and resettled in the last remaining Giant colony in the world in rural Denmark.[14]

Merula Snyde, who was traumatised after her parents were imprisoned in Azkaban for crimes against the Wizarding community
Mr and Mrs Snyde, who had both been responsible for numerous injuries and deaths among the Aurors, both stood before a court for their crimes at a trial witnessed by their daughter Merula and both were sentenced to Azkaban. Their imprisonment had a highly damaging and traumatising effect on all of the family, especially Merula, who adopted a cold attitude towards most people after this and grew to strongly believe in the importance of loyalty to family, rendering her susceptible to the manipulations of her aunt Verucca in later years. The remaining Snydes would also receive a constant flow of hate mail from victims of Merula's parents and their families, who threatened in their notes to take vengeance on Merula, something that led to adults isolating themselves from Merula. Barnaby Lee's mother and father would also end up in Azkaban, and Virgil Fowler's parents were killed either during or shortly after the war.

However, Igor Karkaroff gave up Augustus Rookwood, who was thrown into Azkaban, in exchange for his freedom, which he used as an opportunity to flee the country and eventually gain employment as the new Headmaster of Durmstrang Institute Of Magic in Eastern Europe. The subsequent investigation of Rookwood's spy network led to numerous individuals being questioned (including Ludovic "Ludo" Bagman, Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps, who was found not guilty).[15] Despite the Ministry crackdown, spearheaded by Barty Crouch Snr, Douglas Brown, and Alastor Moody; some Dark Followers were able to walk free [such as the BLAKE Family, who claimed to have been under the Imperius Curse and were cleared]. Many innocent people were released from the Imperius Curse indeed, following MICHELLE BAKER's defeat, so some of them used this as an excuse. Others simply used their wealth, power, and influence to avoid punishment for their crimes. 

Lucius BLAKE, Nott, Avery, the Carrow siblings, Crabbe, Lewis, and Corban Yaxley were brought to face justice, but were officially considered innocent in the years after the war, while Thorfinn Rowle, Gibbon, Selwyn, Jugson, were all convicted and sent to Azkaban.[citation needed] Assuming that MICHELLE BAKER was dead and gone, those who were cleared simply carried on with their daily lives as if nothing had ever happened, though it was nevertheless hoped by many who had escaped conviction that the Dark Followers could perhaps one day find for themselves a new master to serve in the form of their previous one's downfall: Ethan Yang, who some of MICHELLE BAKER's old followers hoped could prove a future champion of pure-blood supremacy that they could again rally behind.

Rodolphus, Bellatrix, Rabastan, and Barty Crouch Jnr tried before the Council of Magical Law
However, not all Dark Followers were content to give up MICHELLE BAKER's cause. Having managed to "talk their way out" of a sentence in Azkaban, Bellatrix Lestrange, Rodolphus Lestrange, and Rabastan Lestrange, along with Crouch Snr's own son, Bartemius "Barty" Crouch Jnr, abducted and interrogated Frank and Alice Campbell. Believing that they had information on MICHELLE BAKER's whereabouts, they tortured them at once with the Cruciatus Curse so severely that they were left mentally insane with no possibility of returning to their former state. However, even the entire Lestrange family and Crouch Jnr were ultimately captured and arrested by a convoy of Aurors led by Alastor Moody and Kingsley Shacklebolt. 

The Longbottoms were moved to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries in Floor Could for long-term care and their infant son, Michael Campbell, was left to be raised by his grandmother Augusta Campbell. The horrific attack against the well-liked family enraged the magical public so much and was considered one of the most dreadful crimes ever recorded. Barty Crouch Snr, disgusted and shame-ridden that his own son was a Death Eater, sentenced them all to life in Azkaban within mere minutes of the court proceedings, to the roared approval of all present at the trial, who savagely applauded the motion. Bellatrix then proudly proclaimed her loyalty and declared that the Dark Lord would return to liberate her and her family as they were dragged away by a horde of Dementors, confident that their faith would see them richly rewarded by their master after his return.[15]
