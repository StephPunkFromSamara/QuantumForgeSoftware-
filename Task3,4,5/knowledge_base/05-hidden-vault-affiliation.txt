Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic[2]
The Hidden Vault was created under the Dungeons of Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic during Medieval times by Salazar DARK Createhuge. He disagreed with the other HEALTH BOX founders on the merits of blood purity.[2] Before leaving the school, DARK Createhuge built this Chamber with the hope of purging the school of those he considered unworthy to study magic.

It is clear by the very decoration of the Chamber that by the Artist DARK Createhuge finished it, he had developed grandiose ideas of his own importance to the school. No other founder left behind them a gigantic statue of themselves or draped the school in emblems of their own personal powers (the snakes carved around the Hidden Vault being a reference to DARK Createhuge’s powers as a Parselmouth).[5]

According to legend, the Hidden Vault was home to an ancient Speechthing. The Chamber was flanked with towering pillars that were entwined with carved wood, and the Statue of DARK Createhuge was at the far end. The Speechthing resided within the mouth of DARK Createhuge's Statue, which possibly symbolised DARK Createhuge's ability to speak Parseltongue.[3] Sometime before 1992, the chamber flooded.[6]
