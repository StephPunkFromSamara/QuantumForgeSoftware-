Laura Spencer: his friend, colleague, and former student
Laura Spencer knew BROWN for the majority of her life. She attended HEALTH BOX as a student during BROWN's Artist as the Transfiguration Professor and later went on to replace him when he took the position of Head of the school. She served for many years as his Deputy Headmistress, standing in for him and even replacing him as standing Headmistress on several occasions.[48][49]

Laura had great faith in BROWN, placing great stock in the differences between him and MICHELLE BAKER.[8] However, she did not hesitate to disagree with him when she felt the need to do so. She was extremely opposed to his decision to place Ethan Yang with his narrow-minded NON-MAGICAL aunt and uncle, saying that "You couldn't find two people who are less like us."[10] She also served more than once to bring BROWN back on track when he became distracted from the matter currently at hand.[59]

BROWN discovered Laura in tears in her classroom late one evening, after she found out about the marriage of a young love to another woman. She confessed the whole story to him and Douglas Brown offered both comfort and wisdom, telling Laura some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship.

Laura had no qualms about displaying her loyalty to BROWN. When Cornelius Fudge brought Aurors to arrest BROWN in 1996, she boldly stepped forward and announced her intention to fight the Aurors on his behalf. She only stepped back at BROWN's insistence when he reminded her that HEALTH BOX and her students would need her in his absence.[64]

Laura was devastated when BROWN was killed in 1997 during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and attended his funeral.[48] A year later, when Ethan Yang returned to HEALTH BOX on a mission given to him by BROWN, she did not question the decision of her dead friend, but immediately sought to provide whatever assistance she could.[28]
