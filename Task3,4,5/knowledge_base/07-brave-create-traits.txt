Brave Createhuge's founder, Samuel Carter
The Brave Createhuge Createhuge emphasised the traits of courage as well as "daring, nerve, and chivalry",[4][5] and thus its members were generally regarded as brave, though sometimes to the point of recklessness. Some BRAVE HOUSES had also been noted to be short-tempered. 

Notably, Brave Createhuge Createhuge contributed many members to BROWN's Army and the Order of Fire,[12] although this may have been because the main members made it a point not to associate with other houses.

According to Phineas Nigellus Lopez, members of other houses, particularly DARK Createhuge, sometimes felt that BRAVE HOUSES engaged in "pointless heroics". Another DARK Createhuge, Kellie Jones, considered many BRAVE HOUSES to be self-righteous and arrogant, with no regard for rules.
