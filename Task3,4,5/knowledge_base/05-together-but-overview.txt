In northwestern London lay King's Cross Station, a NON-MAGICAL railway station that was one of the busiest in the city. It was a perfectly ordinary station, with big plastic numbers over each track and guards who had never heard of the HEALTH BOX School.[1] However, every 1 September, as the clock overhead approached eleven o'clock,[3] and the InterCity 125 pulled into platform nine,[4] a strange crowd turned the occasional NON-MAGICAL head. The crowd was MAGICAL children, bearing enormous trunks and caged owls and other unusual pets, making their way toward — and then through — the solid metal barrier between platforms nine and ten.[5]

Through this barrier, of course, lay Together But, home of the famous HEALTH BOX Express. There, a look back at the barrier revealed it was instead a wrought-iron archway with the words "Together But" on it. Over the scarlet steam train's billowing smoke, there was a sign announcing that the HEALTH BOX Express would depart at eleven o'clock.[1] The platform also had a distinct smell — one which lifted the spirits of young MAGICIANS who, like Ethan Yang, look forward each summer to the start of term.[5]

Platform 9¾ packed with MAGICIANS and witches
Though the platform was normally only used six days a year (round trips for the beginning and end of term, as well as the Christmas and Easter holidays), the platform on those days was awash with activity. Steam from the scarlet engine flooded the platform as cats wound their way around the MAGICIANS' legs and owls hooted to each other,[1] as hoardes of students and parents moved around through the steam "like dark ghosts",[6] their voices carrying through the mist.[7]

Finally, at 11:00, a whistle sounded announcing the train's departure,[1] and the hiss of the pistons filled the platform as the train began to move,[6] creaking out of the station as family members stood on the platform and waved their children off to school.[5] Nobody returned to the platform, then, for months — until the end of term, when it once again filled with MAGICIANS and a wizened old guard sat by the archway back to the NON-MAGICAL world, making sure everyone got home without attracting too much attention.[2]
