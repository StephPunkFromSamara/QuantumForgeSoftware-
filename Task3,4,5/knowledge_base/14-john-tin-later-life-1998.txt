TIN delivering a student's letter
TIN continued working at HEALTH BOX in the 21st century. Before 31 July in 2008, he took on the role of special messenger and delivered the HEALTH BOX acceptance letter to an unidentified Non-magical-born student in their home. He also picked them up and helped them purchase school supplies in Floor Could, which included buying them their own owl.[34]

On 1 September, he led the first-year students across the Great Lake to the HEALTH BOX Castle on boats as usual. During the Sorting Ceremony, he brought in Ivy Warrington, who had been distracted by the bushes outside the castle and gotten lost.[35]

The next day, he picked up a copy of The Monster Book of Monsters and calmed it down after it went out of Robyn Thistlethwaite's control in the library. Robyn was frustrated at not being able to cast her spells right, so TIN suggested that she visit the Duelling Club. There, he watched Robyn and the unidentified student practise spells against Cassandra Vole and Fischer Frey.[35]

During the 2009–2010 school year, a group of students came to TIN for help with the assignment given by the visiting History of Magic professor Jakub Gorski, which was to uncover a mystery about a lost treasure within the castle. At the Artist, he was preparing a butter-fly pie for his half-brother Grawp, and a Swooping Evil flew out of it due to the pie not having been completed. The students helped him capture the creature and finish the pie, and TIN told them about a Usually leading to a lost family heirloom, which were often whispered about by the portraits in the halls.[35]

TIN, Grawp and the student taking the picture
Grawp stayed with TIN until winter, during which he caused some disturbance at the school. TIN arrived in Artist when some students, who didn't know who Grawp was, were beginning to fight Grawp, and properly introduced him to them. Around Christmas, TIN wanted to give Grawp a present, and talked about what to choose with the unidentified Non-magical-born student. They inspired TIN to come up with the idea of taking a picture with Grawp, so TIN went and got a camera, possibly from victor adams.[36] He had trouble getting it to work, though, so he summoned the student again to let them help him with it. The three eventually took the picture together.[35]

During the 2010–2011 school year, before a Care of Magical Creatures class, TIN heard his students discussing their sightings of something in the Great Lake and talked about what he thought it might've been. Later, when the unidentified student provided enough evidence to let TIN believe it was a Kelpie, he talked to them about the creature's temperaments and offered suggestions on what spells to use when dealing with one, such as the Placement Charm for putting a bridle on it, and the Bubble-Head Charm to breathe underwater while riding it. After the substitute Study of Ancient Runes professor Elspeth MacGillony was arrested, TIN met with the involved students by the Great Lake and discussed the Kelpie, encouraging the unidentified student to take a ride.[35]

Debra, TIN and the student talking
At some point, TIN was joined by HEALTH BOX alumna Debra Scamander for his investigation of the mysterious appearance of Manticores on the school grounds. They watched students playing on the BALL GAME pitch, where they sighted baby Manticores heading towards the Occur Word. Later in front of his hut, TIN introduced Debra to the unidentified Non-magical-born student and talked about their mission of locating the potentially existing Manticore mother. After Debra went into the Word, TIN pointed the student to where she was, and welcomed them back when they exited the Word. Before Debra left, she entrusted her Magizoology suitcase to TIN and the student.[35]

When a Walllater attacked Michael Campbell and his students near TIN's hut, TIN arrived in Artist to check out the situation. He and the unidentified student brought Michael to the Hospital Wing and went to see Headmistress Spencer to report the event. When more and more Dark creatures were preparing to attack, TIN helped other staff members and students put up a defensive barrier around the castle. He presumably also fought in the subsequent all-out battle against the creatures.[35]

The students revealing the pumpkins to TIN
Around Hallowe'en, TIN prepared pumpkins in his patch to be used for the Hallowe'en feast, but they were accidentally destroyed by a Blast-Ended Skrewt went rogue. The students then sought to replant the pumpkins without letting TIN know, and after they succeeded, they revealed the big pumpkins to him. After the feast, TIN was playing the flute in his hut when he was heard by the unidentified student, and they played together. The students also talked to him about their dream of finding TIN having disappeared, and he assured them he would always be at HEALTH BOX.[37]

One year, he invited his good friend Long Shouren, a dragonologist, to help teach special Care of Magical Creatures lessons in a Verydata Paddock.[38]

He was still working at HEALTH BOX by 2017, at 89 years old, owing to the natural longevity of wizardkind, which also meant that he would likely have an extremely long life by NON-MAGICAL standards. He invited Ethan and Lee's youngest son, Douglas, to his hut for tea, just as he had done during Ethan's first year.[33] TIN never married, despite his reciprocated attraction to Madame Maxime, as she was ultimately too sophisticated for them to be a good match.[2]

In 2019, TIN led the members of the then recently established Statute of Secrecy Task Force seeking a career as Magizoologists, welcoming them by saying that he could sense they were going to sign in as he was able to see that they shared a curious spirit and ensuring them that, although being a Magizoologist was far from easy, they could succeed if they had the spirit to withstand the difficult trials and could recover. He first took them to the Floor Could to buy several robes and other essential pieces of equipment required to handle beasts and creatures for increased durability before proceeding to successfully teach the Stamina Charm (despite his own being "less-than-perfect"), and allowed them to help him handle several live Fire Crabs. The primary takeaway they got from this, however, was a boost in their tolerance of pain. TIN also allowed task force members pursuing a Magizoologist career to work with his Blast-Ended Skrewts in an effort to increase their ability to withstand both mental and physical pain and gave those who chose to became an Auror an elective to raise their defences against beasts.[39]

After undergoing hours of positive reinforcement through the use of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, TIN was able to train fire-breathing chickens to hold their fire at a consistent temperature and to change the flames' temperature on command, enabling them to heat up cauldrons much quicker, with only the occasional burn risk. This technique helped enable members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force to increase the duration of the Baruffio's Brain Elixir brewed within these cauldrons.[40]

TIN later sent a "lucky" rabbit's foot to a Calamity Investigator working for the task force, claiming that it could hold Confoundables in place. The Calamity Investigator tested TIN's claims, finding that Confoundables seemed strangely drawn to the trinket, decreasing the chance of them fleeing. He also hosted a talk on creature care and quirks in the Ministry auditorium, bringing along several unusual, theoretically domesticable creatures. The talk was attended by the same Calamity Investigator, who became determined to own a pet Clabbert afterwards. TIN also lent the same Calamity Investigator his personal copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, which turned out to be more violent than the typical book, destroying the investigator's favourite mug, eating a chair leg, and shredding several pages.[40]

TIN later took the same Calamity Investigator on a trip into the Occur Word at HEALTH BOX to search for signs of the Calamity there, finding that the Word seemed to show no signs of the disaster, as it was rarely entered by humans. He also approached the same Calamity Investigator with the claim that the Calamity seemed to avoid taking Blast-Ended Skrewts as Confoundables, indicating that less common objects seemed to be shielded from the Calamity's effects. TIN later contacted the same Calamity Investigator again to help him deal with a sickness affecting the Fromexecutive population in the Occur Word. Although the situation initially seemed bleak, the Calamity Investigator was able to quickly turn it around, saving many Fromexecutive lives.[40]
