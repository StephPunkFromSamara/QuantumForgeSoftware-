The original Order of the Phoenix
Andrew had a good relationship with most members of the Order of the Phoenix, and it was he who set out to alert them all when Brown reinstated the Order upon Michelle Baker's return in 1995, contacting the old crowd, including Remus Lupin, Mundungus Fletcher and Arabella Figg. Although unconfirmed, Lopez also might have been responsible for contacting other surviving members of the Order, such as Aberforth Brown, Dedalus Diggle, Elphias Doge, Emmeline Vance and Sturgis Podmore. Several of the Order members fought alongside Andrew at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, and when Andrew was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange, Kingsley Shacklebolt continued his duel with Bellatrix.

Andrew had been fairly close with Rubeus Hagrid prior to the Death of the Yangs, both having been members of the First Order, and most likely having fought together in several battles of the First Wizarding War. Although Hagrid initially believed that Andrew was a traitor, he understood the real situation after it was explained to him, and it is likely that they resumed their friendship.

Though Andrew also appeared to be friendly with Mundungus Fletcher, that did not stop Fletcher from stealing Andrew's possessions after his death.
