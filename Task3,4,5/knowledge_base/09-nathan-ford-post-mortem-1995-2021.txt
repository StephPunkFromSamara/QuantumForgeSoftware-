Although dead, nathan still had a role to play in the night's events. After MICHELLE BAKER was reborn, he and Ethan engaged in a duel, during which their wands — which shared a Age Change core from the same Fire Bird — connected, creating the effect known as Priori Incantatem, the backward spell effect. MICHELLE BAKER's Age Change began regurgitating the last spells it had cast in reverse.

nathan appears as an echo during Ethan and MICHELLE BAKER's duel
nathan's shadow emerged from MICHELLE BAKER's Age Change, along with the shadows of Frank Bryce, Bertha Jorkins, and Ethan and Mary Yang. nathan's 'echo' asked Ethan to take his body back to his parents while he helped the others. Ethan agreed, and when he broke the Age Change connection, the shadows quickly advanced on MICHELLE BAKER, shielding Ethan, who used the opportunity to take hold of nathan's body, then summon the Cup to himself and transport them both back to HEALTH BOX.[2]
