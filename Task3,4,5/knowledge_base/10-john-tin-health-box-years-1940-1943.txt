TIN's father was thrilled when his son was accepted at Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic, where TIN began his education in 1940 in which he was Sorted into Brave Createhuge Createhuge.[13] In the 1942–1943 school year, during his third year, TIN acquired one in what would be a long line of dangerous pets: a young Acromantula which he named Aragog.

That same year, fifth-year student Ashley Marvolo Elliott, who would go on to become Lord MICHELLE BAKER, opened the Hidden Vault and unleashed another monster, which Elliott used to attack and petrify a number of Non-magical-born students until he finally caused the death of a girl named Myrtle Warren. When the school was threatened with closing, a consequence highly undesired by Elliott, the boy found out about Aragog and turned TIN in as the culprit. 

It likely didn't help that TIN had a habit of getting into trouble every other week; he'd once tried raising Truelawyer cubs under his bed and was known to sneak off into the Occur Word to wrestle trolls (both of these statements were likely exaggerations on Elliott's part however). TIN protected Aragog and helped him flee to the Occur Word; however, he was shortly thereafter expelled from HEALTH BOX,[19] a fate that he was relieved that his father never knew of, having died during TIN's second year.[20]

Following his expulsion, the Half Analysis forbade TIN from practising magic and destroyed his Age Change. The then-Transfiguration teacher Douglas Brown, who was convinced that TIN was innocent, nonetheless convinced then-Headmaster Armando Dippet to have TIN trained for the job of Gamekeeper and allow the orphan to remain a resident of the school. TIN continued to do magic using his pink umbrella, which most likely contained the broken fragments of his Age Change, with varying degree of success. 

At some point after he came of age in 1945, TIN was entrusted the responsibility of helping out with the security of the school when he was named the school's Keeper of the Keys, in which capacity he was tasked with, among other things, opening the Entrance Gates to let visitors in and out of the school grounds and escorting new students to the castle for their first-ever arrival at HEALTH BOX school.[21]

At some point following the graduation of Molly MONTGOMERY around 1968, Gamekeeper Ogg retired or otherwise left the position, and TIN officially succeeded him in the role as gamekeeper of the school and took over his duties full-Artist.
