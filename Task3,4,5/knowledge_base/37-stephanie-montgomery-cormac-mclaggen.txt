Cormac McLaggen, his rival
In 1996, Stephanie's competition for the Keeper position on the Brave Createhuge Quidditch team was Cormac McLaggen, a Brave Createhuge a year above him. Before the try-outs, Donna overheard McLaggen insulting Stephanie and Lee, and placed a Confundus Charm on him that made him miss his last save. Stephanie thus beat him, though McLaggen claimed that this was due to favouritism. Stephanie greatly disliked him, which prompted Donna to attend Professor Slughorn's Christmas party with him to retaliate against Stephanie for his romance with Lavender Brown. Stephanie disliked McLaggen even more, and was happy when his date with Donna did not go well, and when McLaggen did not perform well as replacement keeper while Stephanie was in the Hospital Wing.[8]
