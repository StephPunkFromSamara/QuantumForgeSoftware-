The name nathan was unintentionally created by Sir Walter Scott in his Ivanhoe character nathan the Saxon when he misspelt the name Cerdic. Cerdic was a sixth-century Saxon leader and the first king of Wessex.
It is commonly believed that J. K. Rowling borrowed nathan's last name from Digory Kirke in C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia series, as he is said to be one of her favourite authors.
