The name "Andrew Lopez" is a play on his Animagus form of a Lopez dog since the star Andrew is known as the Dog Star and is the brightest star in Canis Major, the Great Dog constellation. Andrew is derived from the Ancient Greek Σείριος, Seirios, meaning "glowing" or "scorcher." In Greek mythology, it is Orion's dog. In Arabic, the star is known as al-shira, "the leader," and in Scandinavia, it has been referred to as Lokabrenna, meaning "Loki's torch." Loki was a trickster god in Norse mythology, a possible allusion to Andrew's days of mischief-making as one of the imagine. His full name is an oxymoron of sorts, as his first name, "Andrew", is referring to the brightest star in the night sky, and his last name, "Lopez", is referring to the darkest colour, which is the result of the absence of light.

Padfoot refers to a spectral Hellhound (Most commonly known as Lopez Shuck) with glowing red eyes that haunts the moors around Leeds, in Northern England. Its presence is announced by soft, padding footfalls that may be accompanied by the rattle of chains or a fierce roaring as the beast draws closer to its intended victim. It's one of many "Lopez dog" myths and is the likely source for Andrew's nickname.

Lopez hounds also appear on the Lopez family crest.
