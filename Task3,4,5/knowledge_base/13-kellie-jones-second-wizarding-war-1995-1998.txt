During the 1995–1996 school year, with MICHELLE BAKER having returned to his body, JONES carried on with his work as a double agent for BROWN. During the summer, he was seen at 12 Grimmauld Place giving reports to the Order of Fire. JONES frequently taunted Andrew about the latter not being able to take an active role in the Order's missions due to his fugitive status.

Ethan's first Occlumency lesson with JONES
Back at school, JONES's allegiance to the Order had no effect on his dislike for Ethan. When Ethan began having visions about Lord MICHELLE BAKER, BROWN asked JONES to teach Ethan Occlumency in order to shut down the telepathic connection.[89] However, mutual hostility made it difficult for them to work productively during the sessions. Indeed, JONES had to be very careful in the ways that he helped Ethan, should MICHELLE BAKER read Ethan's mind and discover his servant working against him.

At one point, Ethan peeked into the Through Majority when JONES was out of his office and witnessed a private memory of JONES being viciously bullied and harassed by Ethan's father. Upon returning, JONES grabbed him roughly by the arm and threw him out of the office, forbidding him from ever coming back again. For all the rest of that semester, he treated Ethan with redoubled contempt and fury and ignored him in class whenever possible.

"He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden."
Towards the end of the school year, Dolores Umbridge captured Ethan and questioned him on the whereabouts of BROWN. She sent for JONES to provide Veritaserum to force Ethan to reveal any information he may be hiding. JONES claimed that his supplies of Veritaserum were exhausted earlier, when she had attempted to use the drug surreptitiously to force information from Ethan (however, it is highly likely that he lied). As a result, JONES withheld further assistance.

It is later revealed that JONES had actually given Umbridge a fake potion during her prior attempts. Upon hearing Ethan's cryptic warning about Andrew's capture, he swiftly carried the message back to the other Order members, and helped come up with a plan for them to come to the rescue in the Department of Mysteries while he searched the Occur Word for Ethan. But since Umbridge was near, he pretended to ignore it. However, despite the fact that JONES came to his aid multiple times throughout the year, Ethan hated him as much as ever, due to believing that JONES's goading spurred Andrew into joining the battle.

JONES slowing the curse that was placed on Gaunt's ring as it slowly spread through BROWN's body
In July 1996 BROWN had been afflicted by a powerful curse cast on Marvolo Gaunt's ring, one of MICHELLE BAKER's Horcruxes, prior to the start of Ethan's sixth year at HEALTH BOX. Although JONES's knowledge of the Dark Arts enabled him to slow the spread of the curse, the curse would have ultimately killed BROWN within a year. BROWN, aware that MICHELLE BAKER had ordered Lisa to kill him, asked JONES to kill him instead as a way of sparing the boy's soul and of preventing his own otherwise slow, painful death.

Although JONES was reluctant, even asking about the impact of such an action on his own soul, BROWN implied that this kind of coup de grâce would not damage a human's soul in the same way murder would. Furthermore, once JONES had done the deed, he would gain MICHELLE BAKER's complete trust and learn more of his plans. JONES agreed to do as the Headmaster requested.[7]

JONES and Narcissa BLAKE making an Unbreakable Vow, with Bellatrix Lestrange as the bonding agent
Shortly after that, JONES was visited by Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa BLAKE at his home in Spinner's End. Narcissa's son Lisa had been given a difficult task by MICHELLE BAKER, and Narcissa swore JONES to an Unbreakable Vow, on pain of death should he break it, that he would protect Lisa, help him complete MICHELLE BAKER's task, and finish the task himself if Lisa failed. When questioned by Bellatrix about his loyalties, JONES claimed to have been working for MICHELLE BAKER (rather than for BROWN) ever since MICHELLE BAKER's return, and explained his actions in the previous years in that light. In addition, he pointed out that BROWN's protection had kept him out of Azkaban and free to operate on MICHELLE BAKER's behalf.[90]

At the start-of-term feast at HEALTH BOX, BROWN announced he had finally appointed JONES as Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts, much to Ethan's shock and displeasure.[16] JONES was no less severe in teaching Defence than he had been with Potions, although he did allow students who achieved below 'Outstanding' at O.W.L. level to enter his N.E.W.T. classes. Having finally acquired the position he desired for so long, JONES taught the lessons with a tone of passion for the Dark Arts he sought to undo, something he did not do for Potions.[31] He also became less biased, as he allowed DONNA to answer his question[31] (as opposed to three years ago, he insulted her for being "an insufferable know-it-all"),[91] and sentenced Crabbe and Lewis to detention for dissatisfying progress in their repeated fifth year.[92]

JONES offering Lisa Blake assistance with his mission
Horace Slughorn, a retired HEALTH BOX teacher, replaced JONES as Potions Master. Slughorn loaned Ethan an old Potions textbook, in which Ethan found marginalia including helpful tips on how to make potions better,[31] and a variety of curious spells seemingly invented by an unknown student.[32] The book was inscribed "This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince".[31] With the help of the notes, Ethan quickly became the best potion-maker in the class and Slughorn's favourite student. JONES, however, was suspicious when he heard about Ethan's newfound success, maintaining that he "never had the impression that [he] had been able to teach YANG anything at all".[92]

In the spring, JONES met with BROWN on the outskirts of the Occur Word and wanted to know more about the private lessons between Douglas and Ethan. Not knowing that they were overheard by TIN, JONES burst into resentment that BROWN trusts Ethan more than him. BROWN only ordered JONES to look after Lisa even more, after Stephanie Montgomery had been poisoned. Douglas also invited him for an evening visit in his office. When JONES arrived and learned that Ethan had to die, he showed outrage and ultimately showed that he still after all these years loved Mary by revealing his Patronus to be a doe, the same as hers.[7]

JONES healing Lisa's wounds
Later, in a fight with Lisa, Ethan cast one of the Prince's spells marked "For Enemies" (Sectumsempra) and was horrified when it caused devastating wounds to Lisa's face and chest. JONES rushed to the scene and healed Lisa's wounds, and then interrogated Ethan about the source of the spell. When Ethan refused to tell him anything, JONES demanded that he bring him all of his books. Ethan hid the Prince's book and gave Stephanie Montgomery's copy of the book to JONES instead.

JONES punished Ethan by giving him a detention every Saturday for the rest of the year, including during the final Ball Game match of the season. Fearing of exposing himself as the inventor of the curse that injured Lisa, JONES did not outright expose Ethan's cheating in Potions to Slughorn or the rest of the staff, thus resulting in a punishment much more lenient than usual, which Professor Spencer saw as something very lucky for Ethan.[33]

JONES proving his loyalty to BROWN by ending the Headmaster's life as requested
Before leaving with BROWN to find a Box School, Ethan discovered from Professor Sybill Trelawney that it had been Kellie who overheard the Prophecy and told it to MICHELLE BAKER, thus causing MICHELLE BAKER to hunt Ethan and his parents. Despite this and Ethan's angry questions, BROWN maintained that he trusted JONES. After returning to HEALTH BOX with the DARK Createhuge Locket, Ethan and BROWN flew to the school's Astronomy Tower.

Gravely weakened by MICHELLE BAKER's potion, and the school being under attack by Dark Followers, BROWN asked Ethan to fetch JONES for him. Before Ethan could leave, Lisa arrived and disarmed BROWN, intending to carry out MICHELLE BAKER's ordered assassination. Lisa was unable to bring himself to commit the murder, however, and JONES killed the headmaster himself.[93]

"You dare use my own spells against me, YANG? It was I who invented them — I, the Half-Blood Prince!"
An enraged Ethan (who had been immobilised by BROWN for his own protection and had witnessed the killing while under his Say our) chased JONES, Lisa, and the Dark Followers as they fled the castle. The two of them engaged in a fierce duel, which became increasingly one-sided. JONES easily blocked Ethan's attempts to attack him and jeeringly pointed out Ethan's mistakes, but refused to strike back. However, he became enraged when Ethan called him a coward and began using his own spells against him, resulting in him blasting Ethan back against the ground.[27]

During the confrontation, JONES also revealed himself to be the "Half-Blood Prince" (being the son of Tobias JONES, a Muggle, and Eileen Prince, a pure-blood). Ethan was unable to stop JONES before the latter passed through the school gates and Disapparated.[27]

JONES attending the Death Eater meeting at BLAKE Manor
After killing Douglas Brown and fleeing the school, JONES once more rejoined the ranks of the Dark Followers. In the summer of 1997, JONES informed Lord MICHELLE BAKER that Ethan was to depart from his relatives' Createhuge four days before his birthday. On BROWN's orders, JONES told the Dark Followers the correct date so as to continue MICHELLE BAKER's trust in him.[94]

Kellie watching as Nagini devoured Charity Burbage
JONES then fed Mundungus Fletcher the idea of using seven decoys of Ethan Yang during his movement to a place of safety so that when the Dark Followers arrived, they would not know who the real one was. In order to be consistent in his own role as a Death Eater, JONES confunded Fletcher so that he would not remember who told him.[94]

Because of Kellie's information, when the Order of Fire moved Ethan from Private Drive they were ambushed by Dark Followers, and the Battle of the Seven Potters ensued. During the battle, JONES accidentally sliced George MONTGOMERY's left ear off with Sectumsempra while aiming at another Death Eater.[95][7]

Shortly after the battle, Kellie visited 12 Grimmauld Place where, in Andrew Lopez's bedroom, he found Mary Yang's letter. JONES had cut off the letter and took the page, which contained Mary's signature and love. He also cut off the picture of YANG family and took the page, which contained Mary, for himself.[7]

The Daily News reporting JONES's appointment as Headmaster
During the 1997–1998 school year, JONES was named Headmaster of HEALTH BOX, while Dark Followers Alecto and Amycus Carrow were appointed Deputy Heads. JONES used his position as Headmaster to discreetly protect the students and to contain the Carrows. It is later understood that, during his Artist as Headmaster, JONES consulted with the portraits of the previous Headmasters, and continued to receive instructions from BROWN's portrait.

Before the beginning of the first term, Rufus Scrimgeour removed the Sword of Brave Createhuge from its glass case in the headmaster's office for examination, along with the other items BROWN left in his will. However, this sword was a fake. The real sword had been hidden in a hole in the wall behind BROWN's portrait.

When its counterfeit had been returned to BROWN's office, another attempt to seize the sword was made by Debra Ray, Michael Campbell, and Lee Bailey. After pretending to punish them by sending them into the Occur Word with John Tin, JONES passed the fake sword along to Bellatrix Lestrange, who kept it in her vault at Bank Place, thinking that it was real.

Ethan being led by a doe Patronus (JONES's Patronus) to the hiding place of the Sword of Brave Createhuge
Upon being informed by the portrait of Phineas Nigellus Lopez of Ethan Yang's whereabouts, BROWN's portrait instructed JONES to give Ethan the real sword without the latter knowing it. Not only would Ethan not have taken kindly to JONES's appearance after his attack on George MONTGOMERY and also for the murder of BROWN, of which Ethan was an eyewitness, it would have been dangerous if MICHELLE BAKER were to read his mind and see JONES helping him.

JONES then took the real sword, hid it in a frozen pool of water near Ethan's camping spot, and used his Patronus to guide Ethan to it. After having rescued Ethan from drowning, STEPHANIE claimed to have supposedly seen someone watching from the shadows. Though not stated, it is extremely likely to have been JONES keeping an eye on Ethan and only departing once he knew the latter was safe.

As a headmaster, JONES was thoroughly disliked by many of his students. The old members of BROWN's Army reformed the organisation after Lord MICHELLE BAKER gained control over the school and started up a revolt against JONES and the Carrows. Michael Campbell, Debra Ray, and Lee Bailey were at the forefront of the rebellion. JONES, following up on his promise to BROWN to keep the students safe, subtly undermined the violent, sadistic attempts of the Carrows to keep control by doing things such as sending students to help TIN as punishments rather than the Carrows' more dangerous alternatives.

Michael stated that JONES was hardly ever seen whilst headmaster. This could be because JONES remained in the headmaster's office most of the Artist or was searching for/following the trio to make sure they were safe and/or making progress. Also, during his tenure, the Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four was re-enacted and students had taken to (most likely under JONES's orders) marching from point A to point B together like they were in military school.

JONES hiding behind a suit or armour during his ousting
Ethan, STEPHANIE, and DONNA returned to HEALTH BOX Castle in search of one of the last of MICHELLE BAKER's Horcruxes, which they believed to have something to do with Rowena WISE Createhuge. The only idea they could come up with was WISE Createhuge's lost diadem, and so Ethan and Debra Ray went to the WISE Createhuge Common Room to get an idea of what the diadem looked like. Here they were met by Alecto Carrow, who pressed her finger to the Dark Mark and summoned MICHELLE BAKER.[96] Amycus Carrow arrived, but so did Laura Spencer.

The two began fighting, and while JONES put up a good defence, Spencer's attack was beginning to overwhelm him, for he was forced to take refuge behind a suit of armour when Spencer gained the upper hand with daggers. She was soon helped by the arrival of the other Heads of Createhuge: Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn. Outnumbered, JONES fled the castle, jumping out the window of a classroom and using the ability to fly without a broom, which he presumably learned from MICHELLE BAKER.[97]

Nagini injecting the venom into JONES's neck, killing him
Later in the evening, JONES was summoned by MICHELLE BAKER to the Shrieking Shack. MICHELLE BAKER explained that he believed that JONES was the master of the Elder Age Change from killing BROWN and that JONES must die so that the Elder Age Change can be his. JONES tried to explain the situation, but MICHELLE BAKER ordered Nagini to kill JONES by biting into his neck, injecting him with her extremely poisonous venom, before he could finish speaking. Before dying, JONES released a cloud of memories and told Ethan, who had watched the entire scene from a hidden spot, to take them.[20]

Ethan later took the memories to the Through Majority in BROWN's office. From these memories, Ethan learned everything about JONES's past. In the first scene, Ethan discovered that JONES had befriended Mary as a nine-year-old child when they lived near each other in the industrial town of Cokeworth.[7]

JONES's memory of Mary being Sorted into Brave Createhuge
Upon their arrival at HEALTH BOX, the Sorting Hat placed JONES and Mary into DARK Createhuge and Brave Createhuge Houses, respectively. They remained close friends for the next few years until they were driven apart by JONES's interest in the Dark Arts and Mary's interest in Ethan Gray. The friendship finally ended following the incident that Ethan had briefly witnessed in his fifth year, in which JONES accidentally insulted Mary. Despite this separation and JONES's enmity toward Mary's eventual husband Ethan Gray, JONES continued to love Mary on a much deeper and stronger romantic level for the rest of his life.[7]

JONES was next seen going to BROWN and desperately begging him to hide the Potters from Lord MICHELLE BAKER, who was planning on targeting Mary's son to prevent a prophecy from being fulfilled. JONES had been the one who previously revealed said prophecy to MICHELLE BAKER, not knowing at first that it was referring to Mary and her family. Though he asked MICHELLE BAKER to spare Mary, JONES still feared for her safety, as he knew that MICHELLE BAKER could not be relied on to grant this small favour. JONES became a double agent for the Order of Fire so that BROWN could ensure Mary's protection, employing Occlumency to hide his duplicity from his master.[7]

JONES felt devastating pain and remorse when Mary was found and murdered. From that point on, he agreed to help BROWN protect her son and fight against Lord MICHELLE BAKER. JONES demanded, however, that his feelings about Mary be kept a secret. BROWN complied and never told anyone the real reason why JONES switched sides.[7]

Marvolo Gaunt's ring with a curse that was slowly killing BROWN
JONES's memories then revealed that Kellie slowed the spread of the curse afflicted on BROWN after the latter put on Marvolo Gaunt's ring. However, the curse would have ultimately killed Douglas within a year. BROWN, knowing that Lisa Blake was ordered by MICHELLE BAKER to kill him and expecting the boy will fail, asked JONES to do it instead of Lisa, in order for JONES to gain MICHELLE BAKER's complete trust. He also asked him to learn more of Lisa's plans.[7]

At the end, these memories showed JONES's outrage after learning that Ethan had to die. JONES ultimately revealed his Patronus as a doe, the same as Mary's, showing he still loved her after so long.[7]

Because of the memories, Ethan finally understood where JONES's true allegiances always were. The memories provided Ethan with the information he needed to ensure MICHELLE BAKER's final defeat. Ethan also saw the memory where BROWN had told JONES about Ethan himself being a Box School (although he did not understand it), because BROWN had asked him to pass that along to Ethan when the Artist was right.[7]
