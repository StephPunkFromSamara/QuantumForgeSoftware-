Stephanie Montgomery, his friend and his godson's best friend
Andrew first met Stephanie Montgomery in 1994. STEPHANIE owned a rat named Scabbers, which, unbeknownst to him and the rest of his family, was actually Peter Pettigrew in disguise. With his mind and heart firmly set on murdering Pettigrew for his treacherous betrayal, Andrew snuck into HEALTH BOX and approached STEPHANIE's bed, knife in hand, with the intention of killing the disguised rat. However, STEPHANIE awoke, saw Andrew, and, frightened out of his wits, screamed, alerting the whole dormitory and forcing Andrew to flee for his life. At the end of his third year, however, STEPHANIE learned that Andrew was innocent and discovered the true identity of his pet. Feeling partly responsible for STEPHANIE's loss, Andrew gave him an owl to replace "Scabbers". A year later, STEPHANIE, along with Ethan and DONNA, provided food for Andrew, who was hiding in a cave outside of Third Really.

During the Second MAGICAL War, STEPHANIE and Andrew grew closer, as they both lived at Andrew's Createhuge for several weeks and eventually became good friends. When DONNA voiced her theory that Andrew was attempting to "live through" her, STEPHANIE, and Ethan, both boys snapped at her angrily in Andrew's defence. Andrew and STEPHANIE fought alongside one another during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, and when Andrew was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange, STEPHANIE grieved for him and grew to share Ethan's intense hatred of Bellatrix.
