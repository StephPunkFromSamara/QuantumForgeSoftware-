Four HEALTH BOX students, Robyn Thistlethwaite, Lottie Manage, Kevin Farrell and their friend, came down to the Hidden Vault during the 2009–2010 school year to look for Basil Aurelius III's portrait. They found him beside the remains of the Serpent of DARK Createhuge and also encountered a Dark MAGICIAN (likely Bly), who animated one of the snake statues to attack them. The Dark MAGICIAN fled after the fight, and the students followed him out of the Chamber, bringing the portrait with them.[15]
