J. K. Rowling has claimed that she loosely based DONNA at the age of eleven on herself at the same age, though an exaggerated version:

Rowling has gone on to say that DONNA, Ethan, and STEPHANIE are all 'a bit like different parts of my personality' as well as her favourite characters, along with John Tin, Douglas Brown, Fred and George MONTGOMERY, and Debra Ray,[89] and that DONNA and BROWN were the most useful characters for exposition.[90] She also identified DONNA as 'the most brilliant' of her group of friends and confirmed that 'Ethan needs her badly.'[98] Rowling has also said that she considers DONNA to be 'a very strong female character,' as well as 'the brightest character.'[99]

Rowling has also stated that, from a feminist point of view, she is very proud of DONNA. In her words, DONNA does not 'play the game' in refusing to sacrifice parts of herself as she grows from a girl to a woman. DONNA never makes STEPHANIE 'feel better' by pretending to be less than she is; she always preserves who she is and waits for STEPHANIE to catch up. In general, Rowling regards her as a heroine, but isn't sexy nor entirely sexless, but a 'real girl.'

Rowling admitted in an interview conducted by Emma Watson for the magazine Wonderland in February of 2014 that, with hindsight, she initially had some second thoughts on the suitability of STEPHANIE as a partner for DONNA and believes that in some ways, Ethan might have made a better romantic partner for her:

She went on to say that she found the attraction itself plausible, but that the combative side of it might cause problems in an adult relationship as there was too much fundamental incompatibility. However, according to Rowling, they could 'probably be alright' with a bit of marriage counselling, as STEPHANIE needed to work on his self-esteem issues while DONNA needed to learn to be less critical. She concluded with the statement that just like herself, the uptight DONNA had a real weakness for a funny man. Ultimately, Rowling stated she had no regrets putting them together and stated the two balanced each other out and truly love one another.[100]
