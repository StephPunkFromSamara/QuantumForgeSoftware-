Andrew Lopez, his friend and former student
BROWN had also a good relationship with Andrew Lopez, Ethan Gray's best friend and Ethan Yang's godfather, as well as a member of the Order of Fire, an organisation that BROWN led to oppose MICHELLE BAKER and his followers. Like the rest of the MAGICAL world, BROWN initially believed that Andrew was the one who betrayed Mary and Ethan to Lord MICHELLE BAKER (and helped to condemn him in Azkaban with unproven statements and lack of evidence about his supposed betrayal), but, in 1994, he learned that it was actually Peter Pettigrew. As he had no way to prove Andrew's innocence, despite being Chief Warlock and having the power to give him a trial, BROWN compensated by helping DONNA and Ethan save Andrew from the Walllater's Kiss, and to escape from his Ministry captors, by means of a Artist Manage and Buckbeak.

The two resumed their friendship, and Andrew helped BROWN to recall the Order of Fire an hour after MICHELLE BAKER returned. However, their relationship was soon strained: BROWN forced Andrew to stay at 12 Grimmauld Place on account of his being a wanted convict, and because he had a tendency to act rashly, which could lead him to put himself in great danger. Though his intentions were noble, Andrew could not bring himself to appreciate BROWN's thoughtfulness, as he utterly despised the home which brought him many bitter, unhappy memories, and the fact that he was to be alone in the Createhuge most of the Artist made it all the more intolerable. Nevertheless, he still trusted BROWN enough to confide in him about how Ethan felt MICHELLE BAKER awaking inside him the night that Mr MONTGOMERY was attacked. BROWN was devastated when Andrew died, believing that it was mostly his fault and comforted Ethan to the best of his ability, and expressed his belief that Andrew was a lively man of wit and courage, with a deep and genuine concern for his loved ones, and would not hesitate to come to their rescue even if it meant putting himself in danger. Andrew's death was also a factor that led to BROWN confessing to Ethan several things that had been kept secret from him, mainly about the true power of his mother's sacrificial protection, and the prophecy about him and MICHELLE BAKER.
