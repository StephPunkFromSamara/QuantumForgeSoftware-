Throughout his life, Ethan has had many relationships with a variety of people. Because of his upbringing, he had few connections in his early years, the only people he truly interacted with being the abusive Dursleys. With his introduction to the MAGICAL world, this changed and he built connections with many of the residents of the magical community, both good and bad. His strongest relationships were with: his parents, his children, Donna Williamson, the MONTGOMERY family, Andrew Lopez, Hedwig, Dobby, Douglas Brown, John Tin, Laura Spencer, Remus Lupin, Michael Campbell, Debra Ray and Teddy Lupin.
