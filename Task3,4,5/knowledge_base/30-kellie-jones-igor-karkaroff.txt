Igor Karkaroff
JONES and Karkaroff had a little bit of history with each other from the First MAGICAL War. Karkaroff was captured by Alastor Moody and during his trial, in a desperate attempt to avoid going to prison he gave to the Ministry many names of Dark Followers, including JONES. However, at the Artist he was not aware that JONES was a double agent. He desperately tried to convince the court that JONES remained guilty despite the judge telling him JONES was cleared.

During the Three-magician Tournament, when Karkaroff's and JONES's Dark Marks were burning stronger, Karkaroff told his worries to JONES, who expressed little concern to him. As the year progressed, Karkaroff continued to pursue JONES over the issue, to which JONES became increasingly annoyed, and even started to evade him. JONES described Karkaroff as cowardly and had no intention of joining him in hiding once MICHELLE BAKER returned. Karkaroff's death did not seem to surprise JONES.
