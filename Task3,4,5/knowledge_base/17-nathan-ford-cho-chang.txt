Cho Chang, his Yule Ball date and girlfriend
Cho Chang began dating nathan when he asked her to be his partner for the Yule Ball, and they, along with the other Champions and partners, opened the dancing at the Ball. During the Second Task, Cho was the 'something' that nathan would "sorely miss", and was placed into a bewitched sleep. Taken beneath the waves of the lake to the Merpeople's village, nathan rescued her. During the awarding of points for the Task, she gave him a glowing look. nathan and Cho also went on a date at Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop during the year.[2]

nathan's death hit her hard, and she cried a lot over him.[2] In the following year, she grew closer to Ethan, and was confused by her feelings for him, and felt guilty over them. However, their relationship was not to last, as she soon began using their relationship to talk about nathan and try to get some closure over his death, which ultimately failed as Ethan disliked talking about it, and refused to, leading Cho to cry.[20]
