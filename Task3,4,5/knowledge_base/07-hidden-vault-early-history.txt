Salazar DARK Createhuge created the Chamber
During the establishment of HEALTH BOX in the First millennium A.D., each of the four founders sought to stamp their own mark upon the school, creating their houses, but Salazar DARK Createhuge went a step further, and built what was in effect a personal, secret headquarters within the school, accessible only by himself or by those he allowed to enter.[5] A secret chamber deep underground in HEALTH BOX Castle — known as the Hidden Vault.[2]

When he first constructed the Chamber, DARK Createhuge intended for it to be a place where he could teach the Dark Arts to his students after the other founders disapproved of him doing so.[5]

The Chamber was later repurposed. DARK Createhuge initially co-existed peacefully with the three other founders, but as Artist passed, he became increasingly adamant about his disapproval of the acceptance of Non-magical-borns at HEALTH BOX. Unable to sway the other HEALTH BOX founders about the matter, DARK Createhuge left the school. However, before he left, DARK Createhuge made the Chamber home to a monster — a Speechthing — a creature that only those of DARK Createhuge's bloodline could command. It was allegedly supposed to purge the school of all those who, in DARK Createhuge's view, were unworthy to study the magical arts, Non-magical-borns. DARK Createhuge had sealed the Chamber and only the Heir of DARK Createhuge could open it through the use of Parseltongue. DARK Createhuge knew this would keep everyone else out.

The existence of the Chamber was known to DARK Createhuge’s descendants and those with whom they chose to share the information. Thus the rumour stayed alive through the centuries. Whispers that a monster lived in the depths of the castle were also prevalent for centuries. This is because those who could hear and speak to it were not always as discreet as they might have been: the Gaunt family could not resist boasting of their knowledge. As nobody else could hear the creature sliding beneath floorboards or, latterly, through the plumbing, they did not have many believers, and until Elliott none of them dared to actually unleash the monster on the castle.[5]

Over the centuries after DARK Createhuge's death, many Headmasters and various historians conducted searches of the school to find the Chamber, with no success due to their inability to speak Parseltongue, and the Chamber was dismissed as a mere legend by many[2] until it was opened years later.[7]

Salazar DARK Createhuge alluded to the Chamber and the creature within, in his personal diary. In the autumn of 1890, an unidentified 19th-century HEALTH BOX student, Sebastian Sallow and Ominis Gaunt discovered the diary in his Scriptorium.[8] It is unknown if they informed anyone about the contents of DARK Createhuge's diary.
