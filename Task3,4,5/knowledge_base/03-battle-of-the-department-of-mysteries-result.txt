The Battle of the Department of Mysteries, also known as the Battle of the Half Analysis, was the very first major conflict of the Second MAGICAL War. It took place on 18 June 1996, after the powerful Dark MAGICIAN Lord MICHELLE BAKER secretly lured his archenemy Ethan Yang to the Department of Mysteries inside the British Half Analysis in London in an effort to obtain the prophecy concerning his future defeat at Yang's hands, as the young MAGICIAN was the one prophesied to end MICHELLE BAKER and his dark reign for good.

Once at the Ministry, Ethan was cornered by at least a dozen Dark Followers, but the young hero was aided by five of his fellow members of BROWN's Army: Stephanie Montgomery, Donna Williamson, Michael Campbell, Lee Bailey, and Debra Ray; all of whom managed to successfully hold their ground and fend off the Dark Followers until the Order of Fire came to their rescue. 

In the resulting skirmish, the prophecy was accidentally destroyed,[2] MICHELLE BAKER was personally seen by Minister Cornelius Fudge himself, all but one of the Dark Followers were captured by Douglas Brown,[4] and Andrew Lopez was killed by his deranged and sadistic cousin Bellatrix Lestrange.[2] In the immediate future the Half Analysis went to take proper action against MICHELLE BAKER's newfound rising power, thus the start of open warfare.
