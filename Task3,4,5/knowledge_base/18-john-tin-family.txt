Grawp, his half-brother
John Tin was born to Mr TIN, a MAGICIAN, and the giantess Fridwulfa. Fridwulfa left the family because her son was "too small" for her liking, though TIN never seemed to resent her for abandoning him, generally appearing relatively indifferent about his lack of relationship with her. His father, on the other hand, seemed to be a very caring man who was heartbroken when his wife left, and was amused by the fact that, at the age of six, TIN was large enough to be able to set him on top of a dresser.[18] Mr TIN died when his son was twelve years old, and by the Artist TIN tried to find his mother in 1995, she too had died, although he dismissed the issue on the grounds that he barely remembered her. On the other hand, he was saddened by his father's death, though he was at least glad that his father did not live to see JOHN expelled from school.

During his travels to the Northern giant colonies that same year, TIN found his maternal half-brother: an undersized giant called Grawp. As Grawp's size made it difficult for him to function within his colony, TIN brought him back to HEALTH BOX and hid him within the Occur Word. As TIN and Maxime's mission had failed, it is extremely likely that TIN also brought Grawp back to prevent his half-brother from being enslaved by MICHELLE BAKER alongside the other giants. TIN's attempts to raise and socialise Grawp initially appeared completely pointless; Grawp's progress in picking up English, or in curbing his violence, which often left TIN with a number of painful looking injuries, seemed almost non-existent.

However, over the course of the year, Grawp grew increasingly attached to his older brother and was distressed by TIN's disappearance after Dolores Umbridge attempted to have TIN arrested in 1996.[20] By Douglas Brown's funeral, Grawp was relatively calm and presentable, and he even attempted to comfort TIN by patting him (though a bit too hard) on the head and later embracing him.[32] Grawp spent the first part of the Battle of HEALTH BOX stumbling around, yelling for "Hagger," but eventually jumped into the fray, fighting the giants brought to the battle by MICHELLE BAKER.[33]
