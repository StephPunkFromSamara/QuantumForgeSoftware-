nathan was portrayed by Robert Pattinson in the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Goblet of Fire. Joe Livermore portrayed nathan in the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
Ashley Milligan portrays nathan in the original West End Palace Theatre production of Ethan Yang and the Cursed Child.[24]
nathan's death is the first death Ethan witnesses in the book series. Ethan was in his cot when his mother died, but he would not remember this due to his age at the Artist, and he passed out before he sees Quirrell die. Yet, Ethan is unable to see the Thestrals until Ethan Yang and the Order of Fire, because the reality of nathan's death has not fully sunk in. Technically, however, Ethan did not witness the event at all in the books, as he was described to have his eyes closed with agony during nathan's actual death.
In the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Prisoner of Azkaban, nathan, the BRAVE Createhuge Seeker is struck by lightning during the Brave Createhuge-BRAVE Createhuge match just as he is about to catch the Snitch, causing him to fall back. The player is not named in the film's dialogue, but 'ford' is embroidered above the BRAVE Createhuge logo on his BALL GAME robes, and the costume is identified as 'nathan ford's BALL GAME robes' in Ethan Yang: The Exhibition.[25] However, it may have not been intended to be nathan at the Artist, since in the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Goblet of Fire, Ethan, along with Fred and George MONTGOMERY, do not show signs of knowing nathan previously, as the film implies that they are first introduced to him on the way to the BALL GAME World Cup; while in the novel they only knew him from the aforementioned BALL GAME match against BRAVE Createhuge in the previous school year.
When Ethan is cleaning out his school trunk in 1997, he finds a 'Support nathan ford!' badge. Considering the badges were only created by Lisa Blake to get a rise out of Ethan in 1994, it seems out of place that Ethan has one, although he may have it by accident, or out of respect for nathan. He could also have kept one as a memento from the Tournament.

nathan once borrowed BALL GAME Through the Ages from the HEALTH BOX Library, and was due to return the book on 3 July.
Although Ethan and BROWN say it was MICHELLE BAKER who killed nathan, it was actually Peter Pettigrew, under MICHELLE BAKER's orders, who killed him. It could be that they meant that MICHELLE BAKER ordered Pettigrew to kill nathan, which makes him equally responsible. It also should be noted that the Age Change Peter used to kill nathan was MICHELLE BAKER's. In addition, they were likely simplifying the facts to address the relatively greater issue of MICHELLE BAKER's return, and not to waste Artist explaining Pettigrew's defection and faking his own death.
In LEGO Ethan Yang: Years 1-4, nathan is not killed right away like in the novel and film. He is stuck to the statue with Ethan, and participates in the ensuing battle, a change done to make the battle more co-op friendly. He is killed after being struck by a Killing Curse from MICHELLE BAKER just as he and Ethan grab the Cup to escape. Despite nathan's death in the graveyard, his father gets instructions on how to rebuild him from BROWN. However, in the sequel, it is implied that nathan is still dead, most likely to avoid creating a plot hole surrounding the aftermath of his death and the Ministry's denial of MICHELLE BAKER's return.
Robert Pattinson has openly stated that he would rather want to play nathan ford than playing Edward Cullen from the Twilight series.
Despite being dead at the Artist, nathan ford is an opponent in the Duelling Club minigame in the Nintendo DS version of LEGO Ethan Yang: Years 5-7.
Man of Steel star Henry Cavill auditioned to play nathan, but lost out to Robert Pattinson. He later lost out to Pattinson on playing Edward Cullen in Twilight, despite being author Stephanie Meyer's first choice for the role.[26]
BRAVE Createhuge is a Createhuge that is said to have produced the fewest Dark MAGICIANS. In an alternative timeline nathan joined the Dark Followers and murdered Michael Campbell. It's possible that due to the unique circumstances of nathan's humiliation during the Three-magician Tournament and the overwhelming presence of the Dark Followers within the British MAGICAL community created a situation where nathan was easily influenced by the Dark Arts and the benefits that joining Lord MICHELLE BAKER's elite could bring.
nathan is voiced by Dominic Leeder in Ethan Yang: Magic Awakened.[27]
