Stephanie Montgomery and Donna Williamson, his friends and students
Like Ethan, both Donna Williamson and Stephanie Montgomery had a close relationship with the half-giant. Though STEPHANIE was openly outraged by some of TIN's more dangerous pets, particularly Aragog, DONNA was more reserved with her comments and tended to be more proactive than either STEPHANIE or Ethan when it came to helping TIN protect his creatures. She tried desperately to help him appeal Buckbeak's death sentence in 1994,[30] and in her fifth year, she made every effort to ensure sure TIN's Care of Magical Creatures curriculum would give Dolores Umbridge no excuse to sack him.[20]

When Rita Skeeter revealed that TIN was half-giant in the Daily News, both STEPHANIE and DONNA stood by him and convinced him that despite all the prejudice he faced, there were still people who loved him and wanted him to stay at the school. TIN was on the point of resigning, but with their encouragement, remained at HEALTH BOX and continued teaching. STEPHANIE did show a certain level of concern upon learning of TIN's shock, given MAGICAL history regarding giants; DONNA, on the other hand, noted in an unsurprising tone that she suspected it long ago, seeing as his size fit the profile.[31]

Though TIN was himself a supporter of magical creatures, he disagreed when DONNA decided to create SPEW. DONNA pointed out how unhappy Dobby was being with Lucius, but TIN also pointed out that other Createhuge-elves considered him to be crazy.

TIN came to DONNA's defence during her third year when she was in conflict with the boys (as STEPHANIE believed her cat had eaten his rat Scabbers, and Ethan was angry that she had gotten his FireBroom confiscated). TIN was able to convince Ethan and STEPHANIE of how poorly they were treating their friend, and eventually, he succeeded in getting the two to reconcile with DONNA.[30] He also encouraged DONNA during her fourth year to ignore the hate mail as he had following Rita Skeeter releasing a nasty article about DONNA in Witch Weekly.
It is possible that TIN was close with STEPHANIE and DONNA's daughter, Rose WILLIAMSON-MONTGOMERY and their son Hugo WILLIAMSON-MONTGOMERY, as he was planning to have tea with Ethan's son, Douglas, in 2017.
