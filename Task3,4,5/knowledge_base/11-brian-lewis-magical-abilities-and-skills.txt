Duelling: Lewis proved to be a capable duellist when he and Crabbe had to fend off against Ethan on his way to the Astronomy Tower.[12] In the Skirmish at the Room of Requirement during the Battle of HEALTH BOX, he duelled with Ethan, STEPHANIE and DONNA and fired multiple Dark curses at them, meaning he had some skill in martial magic, but he was not skilled enough as he was disarmed by DONNA.[10]
Dark Arts: Lewis was able to perform the Unforgivable Curses and was particularly skilled in the casting of the Cruciatus Curse. Michael Campbell noted that because of his proficiency with the curse, it was probably the first Artist he had been top in anything.[10]
Flying: Lewis was one of the Beaters for the DARK Createhuge BALL GAME team, alongside his friend Crabbe. Like Crabbe, he was chosen for his size and strength rather than skill.[3]
Charms: Lewis had some skills in charm-work, as he was able to cast the Disillusionment Charm on himself to hide himself from Ethan, STEPHANIE and DONNA before they entered the Room of Requirement during the Battle of HEALTH BOX, along with Crabbe and BLAKE.[10]
