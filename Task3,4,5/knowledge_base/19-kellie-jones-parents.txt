JONES never regarded the place where he grew up as a home. Rather like MICHELLE BAKER and Ethan, HEALTH BOX was his real home. It is likely that he suffered neglect as a child. His parents seem to have had a dysfunctional, even abusive, relationship. This troubled, lonely childhood is strongly suggested to have accounted for his severe demeanour, depression, sadness, bitterness, and bouts of rage, as seen later in his life.

Despite having a father who disliked the MAGICAL community, JONES was quite skilled with magic before he even received his HEALTH BOX letter. Andrew Lopez would later remark that, when they first arrived at school, JONES knew more curses than many of the seventh-year students. It does seem that he had a slightly better relationship with his witch mother. During his school years, he nicknamed himself the "Half Blood Prince". In addition, it is quite likely Eileen gave her son most, if not all of his school things. His sixth-year Potions book was, according to Ethan, at least fifty years old.

Since at least 1996, JONES was staying in his family's home during the summers between school years. It is unknown what happened to his parents. As he was only thirty-six years old in 1996, his parents may well have been alive but moved away and left the Createhuge to him. His salary as a HEALTH BOX professor probably made it possible for him to afford other lodging during summers, but his childhood memories of Mary may have stopped him from abandoning the Createhuge.
