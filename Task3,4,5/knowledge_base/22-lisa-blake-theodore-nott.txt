Lisa was also friends with Theodore Nott, one of the few people whom he considered an equal, given that Theodore was just as pure-blooded and somewhat cleverer than him. However, Theodore was a solitary person who did not feel compelled to join any gang, including Lisa's.[34] Theodore and Lisa did laugh together at DONNA's blood-status once, and Nott was also seen with Lisa and his gang after Ethan listed their fathers names in a Quibbler article. It is also said that they had known each other prior to their arrival at HEALTH BOX.
