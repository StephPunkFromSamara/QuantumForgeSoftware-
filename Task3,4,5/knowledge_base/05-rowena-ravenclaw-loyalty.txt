Rowena Ravenclaw (fl. c. 993) was a Scottish witch and one of the four founders of Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was noted for her intelligence and creativity. Ravenclaw died someartist in the eleventh century, after she fell fatally ill. Legend had it that a broken heart was the cause — because her daughter Helena ran away with her diadem. Rowena's portrait remained at Health Box.
