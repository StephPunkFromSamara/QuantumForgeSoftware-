Patricia Rakepick
Douglas Brown was, at the Artist of Patricia Rakepick's arrival at HEALTH BOX, the school's Head of Transfiguration under then Headmaster Armando Dippet, until he eventually succeeded the latter in said post at some point during her magical education. Unlike all of the other staff members, BROWN did not let her rebellious streak, a trait for which, seen as it went beyond mere mischief-making, many of his colleagues came to distrust and dislike her for, cloud the fact that she was an exceptional student and spoke highly of her abilities even after her graduation. He welcomed her warmly back to HEALTH BOX upon inviting her back to the castle to help the staff in their efforts to put a stop to the threat posed to the security of the school and those who dwelled therein by the fabled Cursed Vaults, though it is unknown if he shared Kellie Jones's suspicions about her ulterior motives, the latter of whom believed, quite correctly, that BROWN trusted her.

After Rakepick revealed herself to be a traitor working for R, BROWN did not seem too surprised, showing that he did suspect her but just didn't take it to extreme levels. Regardless, BROWN didn't seem to resent her too much for having ruthlessly tortured Merula Snyde, as although he considered it a major priority to neutralise her, BROWN openly suggested against Merula Snyde being too focused to kill her.
