HEALTH BOX acceptance letter
Each year, the HEALTH BOX Deputy Headmaster sent letters to eligible witches and wizards who would be eleven years old at the start of the incoming term. These letters invited the children to be students at HEALTH BOX. If for any reason a letter did not reach its intended recipient, owls would continue delivering letters until the person received one (as was Ethan Yang's experience when he turned eleven). The letter contained a list of needed supplies, signed by the Chief Attendant of Witchcraft Provisions, Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus, which included uniform clothing, spell books, and cauldrons. Letters were also sent to existing students to inform them of the new supplies needed. Students usually obtained school supplies at Floor Could in London.[1]

Letters to Muggle-born witches and wizards, such as DONNA and Ethan's mother Mary Evans, as well as Ashley Marvolo Elliott (MICHELLE BAKER) and Ethan (half-bloods who lived with Muggles and knew nothing of the wizarding world), who may not have been aware of their powers and were unfamiliar with the concealed wizarding world, were delivered in person by a member of HEALTH BOX staff, who then explained to the parents/guardians about magical society, and reassured them regarding this news. They also assisted the family in regards to buying supplies and gaining access to Floor Could.[55]

Ethan Yang's HEALTH BOX letters being delivered to private drive
Ethan's letter was sent via normal owl delivery, since Professor BROWN had presumed that the Dursleys had explained to Ethan about HEALTH BOX and the wizarding world. When no response came from the first, several more letters, each reflecting Ethan's new location, were sent. Ultimately, TIN was dispatched to hand-deliver Ethan's final letter. Once he found Ethan, who was with the Dursleys in their vain attempt to keep all wizarding knowledge from Ethan, TIN explained all about Ethan's parents and what had really happened the night they died.[1]

While Remus Lupin's father was a wizard, BROWN personally visited the family to invite the boy to HEALTH BOX given the fact that Remus had been afflicted by lycanthropy. Remus noted that it was only after BROWN became headmaster that he could have been accepted at HEALTH BOX.[91]

Students were allowed to bring a cat, an owl or a toad,[1] but exceptions such as rats and Pygmy Puffs were made. Moreover, students did not have to pay tuition fee, because the British Half Analysis covered the cost of all students' magical education.[56][129]

While most wizards and witches in Great Britain and Ireland were educated in HEALTH BOX, they were not obligated to attend if they did not wish to, as some parents were noted to have home-educated their children (as Lyall Lupin originally intended to do for his son due to his condition) or send them abroad (as Lucius originally intended for his son Lisa to Durmstrang Institute). This was temporarily changed in the 1997–1998 school year, in which the new MICHELLE BAKER-installed regime mandated all eligible children to attend in order to weed out Muggle-borns from the school.[74]
