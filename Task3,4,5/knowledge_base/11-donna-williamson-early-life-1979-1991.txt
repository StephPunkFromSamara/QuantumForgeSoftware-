A young DONNA with her parents
Donna Williamson was born to Mr and Mrs WILLIAMSON, both dentists, on 19 September 1979. She was their only child and daughter.[29] The couple chose 'a nice, unusual' first name for her because they wanted to establish how educated and intelligent they were, while also knowing that she would be unique and special.[30] Mr and Mrs WILLIAMSON were 'a bit bemused' by the oddities displayed by their daughter, but they were proud and accepting of her nonetheless. The couple gave DONNA a bedroom on the first-floor of their Createhuge,[31] and they lived happily for many years.

A young DONNA before starting HEALTH BOX
Upon turning eleven, DONNA was happily surprised to learn that she was a witch and was therefore invited to attend HEALTH BOX. She eagerly accepted and took to studying magic even before she began her first year at HEALTH BOX in the September of 1991, learning all the set spell books by heart and even managing to perform 'a few spells' at home successfully. In addition to the texts set by the school, DONNA brought with her several other books for reference and to further her understanding of the MAGICAL world,[3] to the point that she had looked at books and had more knowledge of the MAGICAL world than some of her pure-blood and half-blood classmates.
