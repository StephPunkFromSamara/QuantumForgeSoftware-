victor with his cat, Mrs Norris
Possibly the only being in HEALTH BOX that adams actually liked was his beloved cat, Mrs Norris.[2] She had dust-coloured fur and yellow, lamp-like eyes. Mrs Norris, like her master, was infamously bad-tempered with anyone but adams himself. The two shared a strong bond that linked them somehow; anytime Mrs Norris spotted someone breaking a rule, adams would arrive soon afterwards.[14]

adams talked to her and called her "my sweet".[17] When she was Petrified by Salazar DARK Createhuge's Speechthing, adams was devastated and started sobbing, which made Ethan Yang feel slightly sorry for him, though he felt a lot more sorry for himself, fearing he might be expelled. adams even threatened Ethan after finding him standing by the petrified Mrs Norris, BROWN had to calm him down.[2] It can be assumed that adams was grateful after Mrs Norris was cured.
