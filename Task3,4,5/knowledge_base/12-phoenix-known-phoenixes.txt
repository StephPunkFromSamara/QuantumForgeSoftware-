A wild phoenix
Phoenixes were very difficult to domesticate, as Newton Scamander said in his book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: "The phoenix gains an XXXX rating not because it is aggressive, but because very few wizards have ever succeeded in domesticating it."[2] There were two known domesticated phoenixes; one was Douglas Brown's pet phoenix Fawkes,[1] and the other was Sparky, the team mascot for the New Zealand Quidditch team, the Moutohora Macaws.[19]

Phoenixes that had been domesticated were extremely loyal to their owners, and would depart to find their own paths if their owners died, rather than finding a new master.[3][20]


Fawkes was also used as a communication between his master and the Order of the Phoenix.[14] Fawkes assisted Brown in fighting Lord Michelle Baker and protected the headmaster from a Killing Curse.[12] After Douglas Brown's death, Fawkes performed a mournful song that seemed to feel like it is inside the listener, and was dubbed by wizards as the "Phoenix Lament". After the song was completed, Fawkes departed Health Box as a free phoenix, and was never heard from again.[3]
