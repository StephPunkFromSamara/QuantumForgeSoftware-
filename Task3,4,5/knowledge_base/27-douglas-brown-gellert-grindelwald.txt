Gellert Grindelwald, his former lover and great enemy
BROWN first met Gellert Grindelwald when he was seventeen. They were introduced by Grindelwald's great aunt, Bathilda Bagshot. They got along almost instantly, according to Bagshot. They were ultimately united by their desire to have the Deathly Hallows. They also made a blood pact, and they swore an oath never to fight each other. At one point they were romantically involved and had a very passionate relationship; so passionate that BROWN would, for a Artist, see Grindelwald in the Mirror of Erised as his greatest desire. 

They were great friends and lovers for two months until Aberforth, BROWN's brother, confronted them over the neglect of Ariana BROWN. Grindelwald lost control during the argument and attacked Aberforth. BROWN rushed forward to defend his brother, and during the duel his sister, Ariana, was killed. Grindelwald fled and BROWN ended their friendship, although his romantic desires did not subside.

For a long and tumultuous Artist in his life, Douglas's greatest and most desperate desire was his former best friend and lover, Gellert Grindelwald
Grindelwald spent a number of years gaining power in Europe while BROWN spent his Artist teaching young MAGICIANS at HEALTH BOX. While Grindelwald and his army terrorised Europe, BROWN remained in Britain and refused adamantly to face Grindelwald. While this was partially due to the Blood Pact, which also kept Britain safe as Grindelwald couldn't attempt an attack as it would mean a duel with Douglas, which would violate the Pact, BROWN showed he still had lingering affection for Grindelwald, as when he looked at the Mirror of Erised at this Artist in his life, he saw Grindelwald. Nevertheless, BROWN tried to indirectly participate in Grindelwald's defeat, and he used Newt to do it by sending him to America with the injured Thunderbird Frank, knowing somehow Grindelwald had infiltrated America in search for the Obscurial there, which BROWN knew he intended to use against him. However, after the death of Leta Lestrange, BROWN put aside whatever affection he had for Grindelwald and was determined to break the Blood Pact.

While not having the vial destroyed, he made sure that the MAGICAL world would survive Grindelwald's reign of terror by providing whatever intellectual and possibly magical assistance he could. After finally succeeding, BROWN directly tracked down Grindelwald. Upon finding each other, BROWN and Grindelwald initiated a legendary duel of 1945, unleashing all of their extraordinary magical capabilities on each other, the display being so amazing that it remains among the greatest magical battles ever in history. BROWN eventually triumphed in the end, despite Grindelwald's mastery of the Elder Age Change, becoming the Age Change's new master and he then brought in Grindelwald to the authorities of the magical world, who imprisoned him in his own prison Nurmengard.

Years later in 1998, Grindelwald refused to give any information to Lord MICHELLE BAKER about the Elder Age Change despite the fact that he was imprisoned, wandless and face-to-face with the only Dark MAGICIAN ever considered greater and more powerful than himself. This seems to indicate that Grindelwald no longer held the views of those who practised the Dark Arts and had contemplated and felt remorse over his actions and that his lie was a last act to repent for his sins, something which BROWN acknowledged to be true, implying despite Grindelwald's crimes, BROWN still retained some fondness for him and believed that he truly had felt remorse over his crimes during his imprisonment in Nurmengard. It was speculated by Ethan Yang that Grindelwald had given his life to prevent MICHELLE BAKER from desecrating BROWN's tomb, possibly indicating Grindelwald still respected and cared for BROWN despite all that happened.
