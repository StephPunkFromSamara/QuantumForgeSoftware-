Campaign to discredit Douglas Brown and Ethan Yang
The Ministry immediately began to deny BROWN and Ethan's claims that the Dark Lord had returned, starting a smear campaign designed to slander and vilify them; in particular, BROWN was removed from his positions as Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards as punishment for his refusal to stay in line with Ministry propaganda. However, BROWN professed not to care, so long as the Ministry did not eliminate him from Chocolate Frog Cards. He confessed that he believed that Fudge's persecution of him was of his own free will and not due to the Imperius Curse, though this was small comfort.[64]

Before the beginning of the school year, BROWN was made Secret-Keeper of the headquarters of the Order of Fire and ensured that Ethan Yang's friends did not divulge any information about the Order to him, as he did not want the Order to be compromised in anyway.[64]

BROWN attended Ethan's trial at the Ministry, arriving three hours early at five a.m. by a handy mistake. He presented Arabella Figg for Ethan's defence and offered to call Dobby to testify that Ethan had not used a Hover Charm in 1992 and reminded Fudge that he himself had pardoned Ethan's accidental inflation of Marjorie Dawson. He also commented on the unusual behaviour of the court holding a full criminal hearing for a simple case of underage magic. After the Wizengamot had ruled in Ethan's favour, BROWN left without having so much as spoken to Ethan or looked at him.[64]

When the Artist came to choose the Prefects from the fifth-years, BROWN considered Ethan, but out of sympathy for the ordeals he had faced and the ones still to come, he chose to spare him the added responsibility and passed it on to Stephanie Montgomery. This decision confused some people who had assumed Ethan would naturally receive it and would have shown solidarity with the young wizard.[64]

Dolores Umbridge, the new DADA professor interrupting BROWN
BROWN had come to fear the connection that existed between the Dark Lord and Ethan, and purposely avoided him throughout the school year. When signs of this connection became increasingly obvious, BROWN had Kellie Jones attempt to teach Ethan the art of Occlumency, rather than himself, as he feared that MICHELLE BAKER may have been able to peer into his mind through his connection to Ethan. The Ministry also began to interfere heavily at HEALTH BOX. They appointed Fudge's Senior Undersecretary (Dolores Umbridge) to the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.[64]

Umbridge started her reign at HEALTH BOX by rudely interrupting BROWN's Start-of-Term Feast. Things got progressively worse from there. Umbridge and Fudge slowly passed rules and regulations that syphoned the powers of the Headmaster, while increasing those of Umbridge herself. Until finally Umbridge was granted the new position of High Inquisitor of HEALTH BOX. In response to Umbridge and the Ministry's refusal to teach practical defensive magic, Ethan Yang, Donna Williamson, and Stephanie Montgomery created a group of students that met secretly to learn defence against the Dark Arts. With Ethan acting as the leader and teacher, this organisation was known as BROWN's Army, in order to frighten the Ministry.[64]

BROWN escaping the Ministry workers: Fudge, Umbridge, Dawlish and Shacklebolt
When this illegal society was uncovered, BROWN willingly took the blame; pointing out that it was named "BROWN's Army, not YANG's Army." While Fudge ordered his arrest, BROWN stated that he would not come quietly and easily overpowered his would-be captors with a single spell and went underground, working to aid the Order full-Artist. In BROWN's stead, Umbridge was named Headmistress of HEALTH BOX and took full advantage of her position and authority over students and staff alike.[64]

Unfortunately, as BROWN had feared, MICHELLE BAKER finally acted to use the connection between himself and Ethan Yang. Using Legilimency, MICHELLE BAKER created a vision that indicated that his beloved godfather, Andrew Lopez, had been captured by MICHELLE BAKER personally and was being tortured by him within the Department of Mysteries. Ethan, STEPHANIE, DONNA, Lee Bailey, Debra Ray, and Michael Campbell all rushed to the Ministry in the hopes of saving Andrew. However, the six students were ambushed by a group of Dark Followers, who hoped to force Ethan to recover the record of the prophecy made about him and the Dark Lord. MICHELLE BAKER perceived that it was too dangerous to enter the heart of the Half Analysis himself. Fortunately, Kellie Jones was able to alert the Order to this and several members arrived in the Ministry where they battled with the Dark Followers.[64]

BROWN duelling MICHELLE BAKER
Near the end of the battle, BROWN himself arrived and swiftly captured all the Dark Followers personally; except Bellatrix Lestrange, who murdered Andrew and evaded a spell cast at her by the revered wizard. After binding the Dark Followers with an Anti-Disapparition Jinx, BROWN went to the atrium of the Ministry where Lestrange had been joined by MICHELLE BAKER himself, who attempted to kill Ethan.[64]

MICHELLE BAKER's curse, however, was prevented; BROWN quickly animated a golden statue to cover Ethan and shield him from the curse. He animated the other statues from the Fountain of Magical Brethren to immobilise Bellatrix and alert Ministry officials. With MICHELLE BAKER having arrived in the Ministry, BROWN took this chance to give undeniable evidence that the Dark Lord truly had returned and fought him both to protect Ethan and hold him at bay. BROWN displayed his extraordinary magical capabilities as he calmly countered or dodged MICHELLE BAKER's attacks and returned with his own assault that steadily forced MICHELLE BAKER to go on the defensive, yet BROWN was not fighting to kill, a fact which surprised MICHELLE BAKER. Soon enough, BROWN managed to trap the Dark Lord within an Orb of Water just after having been saved by Fawkes, who intercepted a killing curse MICHELLE BAKER had shot at BROWN while the latter was countering the strike of a fiery serpent that MICHELLE BAKER had conjured. Though BROWN had failed to capture or defeat MICHELLE BAKER, the Dark Lord realised himself that he could not overpower his former teacher, and so abandoned his effort and disapparated.[64]

BROWN telling Ethan the whole prophecy in its entirety
Before MICHELLE BAKER fled the Ministry however, he briefly possessed Ethan, hoping that BROWN would sacrifice the teenager in an attempt to kill him. However, BROWN did not take the bait as he cared for Ethan too much to do it. Fortunately, BROWN did not have to resort to whatever means he would've needed to remove MICHELLE BAKER from Ethan himself, as the tremendous power of Ethan's love, dwelt on his grief for his late godfather, inflicted great pain upon MICHELLE BAKER and the Dark Lord was forced to remove himself and block his connection. With his failure to retrieve the prophecy and his attempt on Ethan's life foiled, MICHELLE BAKER fled the Ministry with Bellatrix, but not before he was seen by Ministry officials, including Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge. With BROWN's credibility realised once more, Fudge's was permanently lost. Henceforth, BROWN successfully ensured that Fudge removed Umbridge, pardoned TIN so he could return to HEALTH BOX and he himself would be reinstated as headmaster.[64]

Once he was back at HEALTH BOX, BROWN consulted with a distraught Ethan. After all the stress and pain that was put on the fifteen-year-old's shoulders for an entire year, coupled with the loss of his godfather, Ethan finally snapped and began destroying BROWN's possessions in an incredible rage. However BROWN calmly levelled with the boy, freely admitting that Ethan had every right to be angry with him, and if anything he should have been far angrier at him. He acknowledged that Andrew's death was his fault, and that if Ethan let him explain, the boy would be free to rage and storm at him, even attack him if he chose to. Managing to appease Ethan, he began explaining the meaning of his connection with MICHELLE BAKER and asserting the meaning of the prophecy. Before the end of the year, he also had the Inquisitorial Squad disbanded and reverted any damage they did.[64]

BROWN trying on Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, activating a nasty curse
During the summer of 1996, BROWN tracked one of MICHELLE BAKER's Horcruxes to the Createhuge of the Gaunts. BROWN journeyed to Little Hangleton, where he found the remains of the shack hidden behind weeds and bush. MICHELLE BAKER had placed many powerful enchantments around the former home of his ancestors; however, BROWN proved skilful enough to pass through them unharmed. When he found the Box School, a ring formerly owned by Marvolo Gaunt, he saw that the Force in the ring was one of the Deathly Hallows, the Resurrection Force.[48]

This Force, according to legend, had the power to revive the dead (but in reality, a spiritual form of the person was brought back instead, much like an echo). His desire to see his family overrode his common sense for just a moment and he placed the ring on his finger, forgetting that the ring had been cursed by MICHELLE BAKER. The curse quickly spread, and were it not for his own prodigious talents, he would have died within moments. Despite this injury, BROWN proceeded to destroy the ring, and with it, a piece of MICHELLE BAKER's soul, bringing MICHELLE BAKER that much closer to defeat.[48]

JONES's skills managing to trap the curse on the ring in BROWN's hand
BROWN quickly returned to HEALTH BOX, where the skills of Kellie Jones managed to trap the curse in BROWN's hand. However, both JONES and BROWN knew that it would eventually spread to the rest of his body. Knowing that the curse would kill him, BROWN asked JONES, that when the Artist came, that he be the one to end BROWN's life, rather than Lisa Blake. BLAKE had been given the task of assassinating the headmaster; in order to spare Lisa's soul from being torn, JONES had to be the one to carry it out. JONES later objected to the plan but was reminded by BROWN that it was the only way to spare him from great suffering. During this Artist, BROWN also shared his insights on MICHELLE BAKER with Ethan by showing him the various memories he had collected, giving Ethan a greater knowledge of MICHELLE BAKER's psychology that would help him in his future conflicts.[48]

Ethan and BROWN discussing memories of Ashley Elliott
Throughout the 1996–1997 school year, BROWN passed on certain pieces of information to Ethan Yang that would be important for the boy in his quest to destroy the Dark Lord. BROWN held private lessons with Ethan, revealing in them much of what he had learnt about MICHELLE BAKER's past, life and Horcruxes. BROWN revealed to Ethan that he made it his business to try and find out about Lord MICHELLE BAKER's past. He did this by questioning people who had known him as a child and a teenager and obtained MICHELLE BAKER-related memories from them.[48]

He collected memories from Bob Ogden, Morfin Gaunt, Horace Slughorn, and the createhuge Hokey. Using these memories, along with some of his own, he discovered that MICHELLE BAKER had created six Horcruxes, an unheard-of event, been guilty of murders that he framed others for, and also figured out what the Horcruxes could be based on MICHELLE BAKER's ego and his long interest in HEALTH BOX: Ashley Elliott's Diary, Gaunt's Ring, BRAVE Createhuge's Cup, DARK Createhuge's Locket, Nagini, and an object of Rowena WISE Createhuge's (later revealed to be her lost diadem). They dismissed the idea of a Brave Createhuge artefact as unlikely as only the Sorting Hat and the Sword of Brave Createhuge remained as items from Brave Createhuge himself and MICHELLE BAKER did not have access to them.[48]

BROWN and Ethan Yang in the Crystal Cave
After much searching, BROWN eventually tracked another of MICHELLE BAKER's Horcruxes to a cave that as a young orphan, he had once visited. As he had promised, BROWN allowed Ethan Yang to accompany him to the cave and help destroy the Box School. Setting off from HEALTH BOX on an evening in late June 1997,[6] he and Ethan Apparated to just outside the cave, being unable to enter directly due to its protective enchantments. Once inside, BROWN located the Box School's second line of defence; a hidden doorway which only opened when it received an offering of blood.[48]

They next found themselves in a vast chamber containing an underground lake, with a solitary island at its centre from which a faint green light was visible. After a failed attempt by Ethan at Summoning the Box School, BROWN located a carefully concealed boat that would allow them safe passage across the lake. During the crossing, Ethan learned of the Box School's third line of defence; the lake was filled with Inferi, which would attack anyone who touched the lake's water. BROWN instructed Ethan on the use of fire as the weapon of choice against the Inferi, should it become necessary.[48]

Arriving at the small island, they found a basin filled with glowing green potion. This last defence could not be removed by Vanishing it or scooping it out; someone would have to drink it to get to the Box School that lay within. BROWN ordered Ethan to help him drink all of the potion, no matter what effects it caused, even if Ethan had to force it down BROWN's throat.[48]

BROWN preparing to drink the Emerald Potion
BROWN drank and he saw a vision of the duel between him, Gellert Grindelwald and Aberforth BROWN and Ariana's death. The drink also was weakening him and made him extremely thirsty as well and caused him great pain (the whole purpose of the potion). He couldn't bear it, but Ethan succeeded at getting it down his throat by telling him it would be over soon. On his last drink he fell unconscious. After a failed attempt by Ethan to revive him with Rennervate, BROWN woke up after his period of unconsciousness wanting water.[48]

Douglas creating a fire storm to ward off the attacking Inferi
Ethan then attempted to summon water for BROWN with the Water-Making Spell, but this proved ineffective as the cavern was enchanted to vanish summoned water. In desperation, Ethan filled a cup with water from the lake. Ethan was only able to tip the water over BROWN's face before the Inferi climbed up out of the lake and attacked them. Ethan panicked and attempted to fight back with a multitude of spells and curses, including the Impediment Jinx and Sectumsempra curse, but none of them worked since the Inferi were too numerous and had no blood to spill. BROWN, having regained consciousness, created a ring of fire around them that repelled the Inferi, driving them back into the lake while he and Ethan escaped in the boat with the Box School. Ethan used a small cut on his arm to reopen the hidden doorway, and once outside the cave they Disapparated back to Third Really.[48]

They would find no rest there, however, as the Battle of the Astronomy Tower had already begun. Ethan and BROWN took brooms from behind Madam Rosmerta's bar and flew to the Astronomy Tower. Once at the Astronomy Tower, BROWN and an Say-cloaked Ethan were confronted by Lisa Blake. Before Ethan could reveal himself, BROWN immobilised him with a silent Full Body-Bind Curse, making it so he could only watch the upcoming event.[48]

BROWN being disarmed by BLAKE
BLAKE disarmed BROWN, and admitted that he, Lisa, was behind the series of attacks on HEALTH BOX students, and that MICHELLE BAKER had ordered him to kill BROWN. BROWN revealed that he knew of Lisa's mission and of the attempts on his life with the Opal Necklace and poisoned mead but allowed him to remain in HEALTH BOX for knowing MICHELLE BAKER would kill him if he was exposed and expelled. BROWN offered Lisa protection, and promised to hide Lisa and his mother where MICHELLE BAKER would never find them. Lisa ultimately could not bring himself to kill the Headmaster, even after the arrival and encouragement of several Dark Followers, who were smuggled into the castle by Lisa.[48]

BROWN's death
However, JONES — who had been called by Filius Flitwick to assist the Order of Fire, sometime previously — arrived at the Tower and, after BROWN pleaded with him, in a way that did not expose JONES's true intentions, killed the Headmaster, blasting his body off the tower and falling to the ground below.[48]

Ethan kneeling over BROWN's body
A while later after the battle was over, Ethan found BROWN's body lying dead on the ground in front of hundreds of staring people, his body broken from the fall. Ethan found the locket and read a letter written by R.A.B. and realised that it was not a Box School, meaning the locket was a fake. Ethan neither knew nor cared what this message meant, and he felt that he and BROWN had accomplished nothing that night and that the latter had weakened himself by drinking the potion for nothing. Ethan started crying over BROWN's corpse as well as straightening his half-moon spectacles upon his crooked nose and Ethan wiping a trickle of blood from the dead Headmaster's mouth with his (Ethan's) own sleeve.[48]
