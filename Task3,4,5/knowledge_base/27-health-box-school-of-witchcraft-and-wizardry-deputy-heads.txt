The Deputy Headmaster or Deputy Headmistress (depending on gender) assisted the headmaster or headmistress in his or her duties. In the event of a headmaster or headmistress' incapacitation, the deputy also served as temporary head until the Board of Governors could select a new, permanent one.[56]
