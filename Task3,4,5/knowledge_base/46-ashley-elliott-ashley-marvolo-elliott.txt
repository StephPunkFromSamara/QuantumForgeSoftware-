Ashley is diminutive of Thomas Θωμᾶς, loaned from Aramaic תאומא taʔuma, meaning 'twin'; cognate with Hebrew תאום  təʔōm.[51] This choice can be explained by the fact that, to gain immortality, Ashley Elliott divided, twinned in a way, his soul into different pieces so as to survive. Also, τόμος (tomos) is Ancient Greek for 'slice' or 'piece', which could link his name to the Horcruxes. A further evidence for that connection is Rowling's comparison of the making of a Box School to the splitting of the atom in terms of significance. The word 'atom' is derived from the same Ancient Greek word with an added negative prefix, ἄτομος ‎(átomos), meaning inseparable.
His maternal grandfather's name Marvolo suggests marvelous, from Latin mirabilis: consisting of from mirari 'to wonder at', from root adjective mirus 'wonderful' and suffix -bilis, denoting capacity. The name also contains the Latin root volo meaning 'I wish, want, will, ordain, suppose, maintain that, be willing, to mean, signify, or denote'. Another homophone, volo also means 'I fly, speed, or move rapidly'. Marvolo Gaunt & his grandson Ashley can be seen as characters who want to achieve greatness very quickly. It could also derive from Shakespeare's Twelfth Night character Malvolio (a punningly humorous name meaning roughly 'I wish wickedly' or simply 'ill-willing'). He is a Puritan who could not have fun and sought to stop the other servants from enjoying themselves. He is 'sick with self love' and dreams of gaining domination. He thinks he is better than the others because he believes he is 'pure'. He is constantly the subject of practical jokes. The quote 'Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them' comes from here. At the end of the play, he swears revenge on the lot of them.
A Elliott is 'a form of word puzzle designed to test someone's ingenuity in arriving at its solution'. Riddles were used as a way to both puzzle the audience and teach them to understand poetic language. Due to MICHELLE BAKER's past being 'a Elliott' until the trio discover he was T. M. Elliott in the second book, it is only logical that he would be named that; moreover, J. K. Rowling reportedly once saw the grave of one 'Thomas Riddell' in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, which is probably the origin of the name. MICHELLE BAKER created his name from arranging the letters of his full birth name, known as an anagram, another type of puzzle.
