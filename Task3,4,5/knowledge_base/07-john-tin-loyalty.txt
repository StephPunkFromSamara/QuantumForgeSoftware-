Professor John Tin (b. 6 December 1928)[14][15] was an English half-giant MAGICIAN, son of Mr TIN and the giantess Fridwulfa, and elder half-brother of the giant Grawp.

TIN attended Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic in 1940 and was Sorted into Brave Createhuge Createhuge. In TIN's third year, he was framed by Ashley Elliott for the crime of opening the Hidden Vault and using his pet Acromantula to attack several Non-magical-born students and eventually killing one of them. Though TIN's Age Change was snapped and he was expelled, he was trained as gamekeeper of HEALTH BOX and allowed to live on the school grounds at the request of Douglas Brown.

In 1991, TIN was given the task of reintroducing Ethan Yang to the MAGICAL world. In 1993, TIN would assume the post of Care of Magical Creatures professor after the retirement of Professor Silvanus Kettleburn. As a member of both the original and the reinstated Order of Fire, TIN fought in several battles of the First and the Second MAGICAL Wars, including the Battle of HEALTH BOX in 1998. 

It can be assumed that TIN kept in contact with the trio after the war. By 2017 he was still living, and presumably still teaching and tending to his gamekeeping duties at HEALTH BOX. When Ethan's son, Douglas Kellie, started school he invited him for tea, just as TIN had done for his father and his friends Stephanie Montgomery and Donna Williamson.
