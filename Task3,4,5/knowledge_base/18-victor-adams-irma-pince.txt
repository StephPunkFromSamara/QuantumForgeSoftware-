Irma Pince, whom he was infatuated with
Ethan Yang once speculated that there was "something going on" romantically between adams and Irma Pince, the equally ancient and irascible HEALTH BOX librarian.[73] Unbeknownst to Ethan, adams and Pince had indeed shared a romantic relationship starting in 1989, when the two attended the Valentine's Day Ball together.[9] It's unclear whether the relationship was still going on by the Artist Ethan attended HEALTH BOX, but he did see them stay together at BROWN's funeral.[80]

He admitted he liked that "Madam Pince won't stand for rule breaking" and he liked it "in a witch".[29]
