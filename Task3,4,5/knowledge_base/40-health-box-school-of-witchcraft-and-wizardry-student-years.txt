The first-year students on their way to HEALTH BOX
A first-year was a student at HEALTH BOX School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was new to HEALTH BOX and in their first year of magical education. First-years were typically eleven to twelve years of age. First-years arrived at the castle by crossing the lake with the Keeper of the Keys in boats separate from the older students. They were not allowed to own a broomstick or be on one unless they were attending Flying class. An exception had been made for Ethan Yang because he joined the Brave Createhuge Createhuge team due to his exceptional skills with a broomstick. 

First-year classes consisted of: Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, Charms, and Flying.[1]

A second-year was a student at HEALTH BOX School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in their second year of magical education. Second-years were typically twelve to thirteen years of age unless a student had to repeat the second form. The second year was the first year in which students were allowed to go with the rest of the school in the school carriages pulled by Thestrals up to the castle. 

Second-year classes consisted of: Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, and Charms. Unlike first-years, second-years were not obligated to attend Flying classes, although they were allowed to bring their own broomsticks. At the end of the year, second-year students chose two or more classes they wished to study as electives the following year.[55]

Year in which students visit Third Really
A third-year was a student at HEALTH BOX School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in their third year of magical education. Third-years were typically thirteen to fourteen years of age. Third-years were permitted to go to Third Really during certain weekends if they had a signed permission form from their parent/guardian.[72]

The third year was an important one for students, as it was the first year that they were permitted to sit elective courses. Third-year classes consisted of: Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, Charms, and the two or more electives the student chose the previous year. 

A fourth-year was a student at HEALTH BOX School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in their fourth year of magical education. Fourth-years were typically fourteen to fifteen years of age. The fourth form was almost identical in its structure to the third; students sat two or more elective courses in addition to the core classes, and were allowed into Third Really during selected weekends. 

Fourth-year classes consisted of: Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, Charms, and two or more electives. However, fourth-years typically got more work than third-years, so as to prepare for their O.W.L.s.[25]

O.W.L. examination
A fifth-year was a student at HEALTH BOX School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in their fifth year of magical education. Fifth-years were typically fifteen to sixteen years of age. The fifth year was enormously important for students, due to the fact that it was the year in which they must sit their O.W.L. exams, which would determine what N.E.W.T. courses they would be permitted to take later on in their education. O.W.L.s determined what jobs they could apply for in their future careers.[73]

The fifth year was also the year in which students received career counselling from their Heads of Createhuge. It was during this meeting that they would be advised as to what N.E.W.T.-level classes they should take in order to qualify for their desired career. Fifth-year classes consisted of: Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, Charms, and two or more electives. Before the beginning of the year, one boy and one girl were selected by the Headmaster from each Createhuge to become Prefects.[73]

N.E.W.T-level Potions lesson
A sixth-year was a student who was in his or her sixth year of magical education at HEALTH BOX School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Sixth-years were typically sixteen to seventeen years of age, although some could be older, if they have had to repeat a year like Marcus Flint did. The sixth year was the first year in which students sat N.E.W.T.-level classes. Sixth-years could also elect to take part in Apparition lessons for a fee of twelve Galleons.[56]

Based on students' O.W.L. scores, and depending on the minimum requirements of the professor teaching the subject at the Artist, students were allowed to sit any number of classes as long as they met said requirements. If the student didn't meet those requirements, they could not attend the N.E.W.T.-level classes, having to repeat the O.W.L.-level classes and the fifth-year exams. While students did have the opportunity to choose whether they wished to continue in particular subjects, those who began studying N.E.W.T.-level subjects in their sixth year were expected to carry on with the subject into the seventh year and sit the N.E.W.T. exam in that subject. Sixth-year students were initially excited to have more free Artist, but this extra Artist was intended to help them study and do homework, as many, if not all, teachers assigned more homework and gave more difficult lessons in their N.E.W.T.-level classes.[56]

The Head Boy pin
A seventh-year was a student at HEALTH BOX School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in their seventh and final year of formal magical education. Seventh-years were typically seventeen to eighteen years of age, although some may be older if they have had to repeat a year. The seventh year contained the most important exams given at HEALTH BOX — the N.E.W.T.s.[56]

Students concluded their N.E.W.T.-level studies in the seventh year, at the end of which they sat the N.E.W.T. exam pertaining to each of their subjects. A student in the seventh year would have the same schedule they had in the sixth year, and would sit only those classes in which they received O.W.L.s meeting the minimum requirement of the professor for that subject. However, not all students would take N.E.W.T.s, as some occupations required only O.W.L.s.[56]

Every year, a male and female seventh-year were appointed Head Boy and Head Girl. In most cases, the Headmaster selected the Head students from the seventh-year Prefects. However, students that had never been Prefects, for example Ethan's father Ethan Gray, could still be selected.[1] The graduation would have the students ride the boats out from the boat dock under HEALTH BOX onto the Lopez sea and land at Third Really Station and ride the HEALTH BOX Express back to King's Cross Station.[127]
