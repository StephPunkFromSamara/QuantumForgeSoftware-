Pomona Sprout, her longtime friend and colleague
The relationship between Professor Spencer and Professor Sprout dates back to when both attended Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic.[17] The two students maintained an excellent relationship, which was kept well into their adulthood.

When Dolores Umbridge stood to speak during the 1995 Start-of-Term Feast after her introduction by Headmaster BROWN, the two professors were both taken aback at this, and even exchange glances of disapproval.[15] During the Battle of HEALTH BOX on 2 May 1998, Laura and Pomona had the same views on protecting the Castle against Lord MICHELLE BAKER's Dark Followers.[12]
