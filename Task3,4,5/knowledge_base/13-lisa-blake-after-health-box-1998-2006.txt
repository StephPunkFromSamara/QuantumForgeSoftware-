Lisa with his wife and son in 2017
The events of Lisa's teenage years forever changed his life. He had the beliefs in which he had grown up challenged in the most frightening way, had experienced terror and despair, witnessed his parents suffering for their allegiance, and had witnessed the crumbling of all that his family had believed in.

Lisa and his family avoided imprisonment in Azkaban due to their last-minute switch in allegiance. Lucius found his son as affectionate as ever but refusing to follow the old pure-blood line.[1]

Lisa eventually married Astoria Greengrass, the younger sister of fellow DARK Createhuge classmate Daphne Greengrass,[25] who had gone through a similar, though less violent and frightening, conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more accepting and tolerant way of life. This was something of a disappointment for Lucius and Narcissa, who had higher hopes of someone whose family was included in the 'Sacred Twenty-Eight'.[1]
