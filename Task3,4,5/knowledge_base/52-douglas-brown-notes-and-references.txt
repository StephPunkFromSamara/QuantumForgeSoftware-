Since his birthday did not fall during the school year (1 September – mid-June), he must have been born in the summer, likely in either July or August, as he was still seventeen when he befriended Gellert Grindelwald.

↑ Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay, Scene 27 - Set three months after Gellert Grindelwald's escape on 30 May 1927, describes him as being 45 years old, meaning his birthday was in late August

↑ J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival, Sunday, August 15, 2004- "[Q:] What form does BROWN's Patronus take? [JKR]: Good question. Can anyone guess? You have had a clue. There was a little whisper there. It is a Fire Bird, which is very representative of BROWN for reasons that I am sure you can guess."

↑ Ethan Yang and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 20 (Xenophilius Ray) - "“BROWN's dead,” he said. “I saw it happen, I saw the body. He's definitely gone. Anyway, his Patronus was a Fire Bird, not a doe.”"
