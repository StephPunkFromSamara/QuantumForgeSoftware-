Ethan Yang, a student he particularly disliked
Although adams disliked most students, Ethan Yang was one of those he disliked most. In 1991, Ethan and STEPHANIE managed to get on adams's bad side on their very first day at HEALTH BOX School, when he and Stephanie Montgomery got lost and inadvertently tried to enter the out-of-bounds third-floor corridor.[14]

The next school year, adams was furious when Ethan learnt that he was a Squib.[15] Then, he believed that Ethan was the one who petrified Mrs Norris, adams's cat, as he was one of the few people who knew he was a Squib.[2]

During the next years, Ethan disliked adams even more, especially when the caretaker took the side of Dolores Umbridge, during Ethan's fifth year.[65]

Due to his dislike of adams, Ethan twice jinxed him with Langlock in his sixth year, humiliating adams much to the amusement of everyone who witnessed it.[74]

However, adams, in a way, helped Ethan and the Order of Fire defeat the Dark Followers, as he helped Spencer call Peeves during the Battle of HEALTH BOX.[10] During the Battle, when the Dark Followers marched towards the Castle with Ethan's "dead body", he was clearly solemn as he stood by Horace Slughorn, Pomona Sprout, and Poppy Pomfrey,[85] despite all their differences, as his death meant the victory of the Dark Followers. It is unknown how adams reacted when Ethan revealed himself to be alive and managed to defeat MICHELLE BAKER once and for all.
