The HEALTH BOX Express as it crossed the British countryside
As we know from early historical accounts, and from the evidence of early woodcuts and engravings, HEALTH BOX students used to arrive at school in any manner that caught their fancy.[1] Some rode broomsticks (a difficult feat when carrying trunks and pets); others commandeered enchanted carts and, later, carriages; some attempted to Apparate (often with disastrous effects, as the castle and grounds had always been protected with Anti-Apparition Charms), others rode a variety of magical creatures.[1]

The HEALTH BOX Express
In 1827, Ottaline Gambol rose to the office of Minister for Magic, and she made a daring and controversial suggestion to solve the ages-old problem of how to transport hundreds of students to and from HEALTH BOX Castle every school year without attracting the NON-MAGICALS' attention. 

Intrigued by NON-MAGICAL technology, the Minister saw the potential of using a NON-MAGICAL steam locomotive as a secure and comfortable alternative to Portkeys or to unregulated means of travel. The locomotive for the HEALTH BOX Express itself was originally built by the NON-MAGICAL engineers at Crewe, in Cheshire, England,[1] in the early-to-mid 19th century.

Third Really Station
In 1920, the Half Analysis carried out a large-scale operation involving 167 Memory Charms and the most powerful Concealment Charm ever performed in Britain to acquire a steam locomotive for student transportation. The engine selected was a Great Western Railway 4-6-0, which was either purchased and modified through magical means or discreetly taken from NON-MAGICAL railway stock. The morning after the operation, the residents of Third Really awoke to find a gleaming red steam engine and a newly built railway station that had not existed the day before. Meanwhile, NON-MAGICAL railway workers in Crewe were left with an unshakable feeling that they had misplaced something—one that lingered with them for the rest of the year.[1]

There was initial resistance from pure-blood families against using a NON-MAGICAL-built device for MAGICIAN transportation. These families claimed that the express was "unsafe, insanitary, and demeaning". This was their stance until the Ministry decreed that students would arrive to school on the train or not attend at all.[1] There is no information on where exactly HEALTH BOX students were travelling from during the period after the acquisition of the HEALTH BOX express and the creation of the Third Really Station and before the opening of King's Cross Station and the Together But in the 1850s.[16]
