Olivia favoured loyalty, honesty, fair play, and hard work, but was known to accept all students regardless of whether or not they possessed these traits. Members of her Createhuge usually display at least one of these traits in varying degrees, however. Given that all of her portraits show her with a wide smile, it can be inferred that Olivia was a very jolly woman. Her affinity for food-related charms and plump shape might also indicate that she had a large appetite.

Olivia was renowned for her compassionate nature and charming ways. She took in the Createhuge-elves to work in HEALTH BOX Kitchen, where they could work in peace and safety. This was considered to be the best option at the Artist for Createhuge-elves. When the other founders were careful in selection of students, BRAVE Createhuge took in those who did not fit the standards of other houses.[13]

She was also a woman of tolerance, willing to accept Non-magical-born students and disagreed with DARK Createhuge's pure-blood exclusiveness,[5] as well as bringing together people of varying backgrounds to construct the school and ensuring a decent working environment for Createhuge-elves, who were generally treated with indifference if not outright cruelty by most MAGICIANS.
