Mrs WILLIAMSON, her mother
Mr and Mrs WILLIAMSON were NON-MAGICAL dentists who seemed proud of their witch daughter. They appeared to be accepting of the MAGICAL world, as they went shopping with DONNA in Floor Could and allowed her to spend several holidays with the MONTGOMERY family,[4] but did not approve of their daughter using magic as a quick-fix, as indicated by their not allowing DONNA to magically fix her teeth.[35] They correspond by owl post with their daughter throughout the school year,[32] but other than one holiday in France with her parents, DONNA spent almost all of her Artist in the MAGICAL world. In 1995, she planned to go skiing with them during the Christmas holidays, but ended up going to 12 Grimmauld Place to try to cheer Ethan up instead. DONNA told her parents that the reason for her cancelling was to study for exams, indicating that her parents expected her to do well in school and were probably not aware of the extent of their daughter's involvement in activities relating to the Second MAGICAL War.[32]

Mr WILLIAMSON, her father
To protect them during the height of the war, DONNA modified her parents' memories in 1997 to make them believe they were entirely different people, and they left the country.[10] After the war, she found them in Australia and restored their memories.

After the Second MAGICAL War, DONNA had two children with Stephanie Montgomery: a daughter named Rose and a son named Hugo.

Rose started her first year at HEALTH BOX in 2017, along with her cousin, Douglas. STEPHANIE stated that Rose had inherited her mother's brains. DONNA was probably very close to Rose because she was also described as smart, yet not a complete know-it-all.

Hugo was born in 2006 or 2007. He most likely inherited his father's BALL GAME skills, as he was noted to fly a lot with his cousins Douglas YANG and Ethan Gray. He also appeared to have a quiet demeanour.

The YANG children, some of DONNA's nieces and nephews
As four of Stephanie Montgomery's five surviving siblings were married by 2017, DONNA had quite a few nieces and nephews through her husband: Ethan and Lee had three children (Ethan, Douglas and Mary), as did Bill and Fleur (Victoire, Dominique and Louis), while George and Angelina Johnson had a son and a daughter (Fred and Roxanne), and Percy MONTGOMERY had two daughters (Molly and Lucy) with his wife, Audrey. Victoire MONTGOMERY, one of Fleur and Bill's daughters, was seen kissing Teddy Lupin at King's Cross Station, by Ethan Gray, DONNA's nephew and godson. DONNA visited them all on many occasions. It can be assumed that she was closest with Ethan's children.

The MONTGOMERY family, her future in-laws
Because of her friendships with STEPHANIE and Lee Bailey, DONNA became friendly with the entire MONTGOMERY family. She spent a portion of many of her summer holidays at their home of The Burrow, and attended some family outings with them, such as shopping for school supplies in Floor Could and attending the 1994 BALL GAME World Cup with them. Arthur MONTGOMERY was fascinated by the NON-MAGICAL world and thus DONNA's background, and even invited DONNA's parents for a drink upon first meeting them. Molly MONTGOMERY was fond of DONNA, though she treated her coldly for a brief Artist after Rita Skeeter printed lies about DONNA toying with the hearts of Ethan Yang and Viktor Krum, much to DONNA's bewilderment. After Ethan explained that the stories were false, Mrs MONTGOMERY once again warmed up to DONNA. Also, she and Percy MONTGOMERY were considered to be on good terms until their fight over Createhuge rights.

Fred and George MONTGOMERY, her friends and future brothers-in-law
Fred and George MONTGOMERY seemed to regard DONNA and Ethan almost like other younger siblings, teasing them as well as being protective of them. When Lisa Blake called DONNA a 'Mudblood' in 1992, the twins were outraged, and attempted to attack him.[4] Although DONNA disapproved of some of their antics, trying to use her status as a prefect to keep them in line, she still got on well with them. DONNA once argued with them that the Ageing Potion they planned on using to trick the age line protecting the Goblet of Fire wouldn't work because BROWN would have already thought of a foolish ageing potion. They didn't listen and tried to cross the line which resulted in them being thrown back and grow long, white beards.The only Artist she was notably angry with them was when they tested out their Skiving Snackboxes on unsuspecting first year students; though the twins initially scoffed at her concerns and her ability to make them stop, they backed down when she threatened to tell their mother.

However, DONNA still admired the cleverness and creativity of their spell work,[32] once remarking that they could do some 'extraordinary magic,' which Fred was flattered enough by to offer DONNA material from their joke shop free of charge.[36] Fred and George also tried to get DONNA to relax, joking around with her about things such as their late uncle Bilius's penchant for making mischief at weddings.[10] DONNA was devastated when Fred was killed during the Battle of HEALTH BOX. DONNA was not as close to the other MONTGOMERY siblings, though she was invited to Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour in 1997.

With her marriage to STEPHANIE, DONNA became a part of the MONTGOMERY family herself.

Fleur Delacour, her future sister-in-law
When DONNA first met Fleur Delacour, an incredibly beautiful, French, part-Veela witch, in 1994, during the Three-magician Tournament. DONNA disliked Fleur almost immediately, as she was given to fussily and loudly criticising nearly everything at HEALTH BOX, from the weather, to the decoration and food. The fact that STEPHANIE had a little bit of a crush on Fleur didn't help, but he eventually got over it.

DONNA, like Lee and Mrs MONTGOMERY, was infuriated by Fleur's arrogance and constant complaining when Bill MONTGOMERY sent Fleur, his then fiancée, to The Burrow to get to know his family. However, when Fleur responded to Bill becoming permanently disfigured by Fenrir Greyback with indignant denial that Bill's appearance would in any way effect their marital plans, DONNA most likely set her feelings aside.

Despite seeming rather inconsiderate and self-centred, Fleur proved to be courageous and ultimately caring, even selfless, in her own way. She put her life in danger by posing as one of Ethan's decoys in the Battle of the Seven YANGS, and after the Battle of BLAKE Manor, DONNA, Ethan and STEPHANIE, along with Debra Ray, Dean Thomas, and an injured Garrick Ollivander and Griphook, stayed with Bill and Fleur for a month at Shell Cottage, where Fleur took care of them all like a mother. Later, Fleur became DONNA's sister-in-law through her marriage to Bill MONTGOMERY, and DONNA's marriage to Stephanie Montgomery.
