Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic[1]HEALTH BOX Express[1]
HEALTH BOX Express[1]
Together But (Platform 9¾) was a hidden platform at King's Cross Station in London. Magically concealed behind the barrier between NON-MAGICAL Platforms Nine and Ten, this Platform was where Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic students boarded the HEALTH BOX Express every 1 September, in order to attend school.[1]

In order for someone to get onto Together But, they had to walk directly at the apparently solid barrier dividing Platforms Nine and Ten.[1] When returning from Together But, there was a guard stationed just outside the ticket barrier, in order to regulate exits from the platform through the gate, in order to not alarm the NON-MAGICALS.[2]
