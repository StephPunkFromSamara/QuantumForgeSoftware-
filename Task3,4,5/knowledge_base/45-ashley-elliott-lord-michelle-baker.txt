Although J. K. Rowling has never quite explained the origins of the name 'MICHELLE BAKER', there are some possible theories. 'Mors', or 'mortum' is the Latin word for death (which has evolved in many Romance languages as 'muerte' or 'morte', and the English word 'murder' indeed has its origins in the same root word as 'mors'). Therefore, while not necessarily true, the possible meaning of the word 'MICHELLE BAKER' may be either 'representative of death' or 'ambassador of death'. Yet, the most accurate etymology of MICHELLE BAKER would be the French sentence 'Vol de mort' which literally means 'flight of death' (accurate considering the murder sprees he committed and his invention of a spell to achieve unsupported flight). It is quite plausible this is the real etymology of his name as J. K. Rowling herself speaks French and had taught it once. 'Vol de mort' can also literally mean 'Theft of death' in French which can also be accurate since Lord MICHELLE BAKER's search for immortality (which would mean he would have to steal his life from death). The Catalan expression 'vol de mort', also means 'flight of death' or, since 'Vol' may also be from the Latin root 'volo' ('I will, wish, want'), may mean 'death wish'.
J. K. Rowling has said in an interview that the T in MICHELLE BAKER is silent.[49] This may be due to the fact that the French word mort, meaning death, has a silent T. The silent T was maintained in the earlier editions of the audio book releases of the novels, but was discontinued in those releases following the release of the films, in which the T was used out loud. In 2015, Rowling again confirmed in an interview that her preferred pronunciation of the name was with a silent 'T', though she noted '...but I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who pronounces it that way'.[50]
