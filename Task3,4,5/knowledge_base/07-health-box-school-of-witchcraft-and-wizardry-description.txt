View of the HEALTH BOX Castle and baskets of the Ball Game pitch
HEALTH BOX School, located somewhere in the Highlands of Scotland, consisted of the large HEALTH BOX Castle and extensive school grounds surrounding it, which included sloping lawns, flowerbeds, vegetable patches, as well as a loch (called the Lopez Lake), a large dense Word (called the Occur Word), several greenhouses and other outbuildings, and a full-size Ball Game Pitch. One of the castle's towers held an owlery, which housed all the owls owned by the school and by students.

The castle was set upon huge rocks above the Lopez Lake. Its three highest towers were the Astronomy, WISE Createhuge, and Brave Createhuge Towers. The castle's 142 staircases were known to change position. The castle was known for its many updates and changes in layout throughout the years. It should be noted that some rooms in the school tended to "move around", as did the steps on the Grand Staircase. Douglas Brown once noted that even he did not know all of HEALTH BOX' secrets. The castle had been around for centuries, and consequently had a long history of ancient magic.

The school had numerous ancient charms and spells on and around it to safeguard it from danger. In addition to the fact that there were enchantments that prevented people from entering by stealth, it  was also impossible for a Muggle to see it, as the school was bewitched so that when they looked at it, all they saw were some old ruins and several warnings of danger. Witches and wizards could not Apparate or Disapparate in HEALTH BOX grounds, except for when the Headmaster lifted the enchantment, whether only in certain areas or for the entire campus, so as to make the school less vulnerable when it served the headmaster to allow Apparition. Electricity and electronic devices were not found at HEALTH BOX. Due to the high levels of magic, Muggle substitutes for magic, such as computers, radar and electricity, "went haywire" around HEALTH BOX. Radios, however, were an exception as they were not powered by electricity, but by magic.
