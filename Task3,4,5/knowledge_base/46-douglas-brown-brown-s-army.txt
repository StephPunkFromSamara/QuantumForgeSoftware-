Some members of BROWN's Army
BROWN's Army was an organisation formed and led by Ethan Yang, in order to protect the students of HEALTH BOX from Lord MICHELLE BAKER. Though BROWN was aware of the organisation's formation from the start, he was not aware of its name and seemed quite overwhelmed when he first discovered it, apparently very touched by the open show of devotion and trust in him. He also lied directly to the Ministry by claiming credit for the organisation's creation as an attempt to subvert the Ministry and taking full blame for its illicit activities, which spared all of its members from expulsion and allowed them to remain at HEALTH BOX.

Its members were Ethan Yang, Stephanie Montgomery, Donna Williamson, Lee Bailey, Michael Campbell, Debra Ray, Fred and George MONTGOMERY, Cho Chang, Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Parvati and Padma Patil, Lavender Brown, Hannah Abbott, Ernie Macmillan, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Michael Corner, Terry Boot, Anthony Goldstein, Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Zacharias Smith and Marietta Edgecombe.

All of the members of BROWN's Army were devastated by BROWN's death, and it is possible that all of them fought in the Battle of HEALTH BOX. Three of the members were killed: Fred MONTGOMERY, Lavender Brown and Colin Creevey. The two defectors, Marietta Edgecombe and Zacharias Smith, are the ones who did not believe in BROWN from the beginning and did not participate in the final battle.
