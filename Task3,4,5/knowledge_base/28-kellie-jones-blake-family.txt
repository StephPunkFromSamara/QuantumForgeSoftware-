Lucius and Lisa Blake, whom he was on good terms with
JONES appeared to be on good terms with the BLAKE family. Lucius BLAKE was a DARK Createhuge prefect when JONES began attending HEALTH BOX, and the two ran in the same social circles, which included other future Dark Followers. JONES and Lucius likely worked together as Dark Followers during the First MAGICAL War. It's unknown if Lucius was suspicious of JONES's true allegiance, though he most likely believed JONES to be truly loyal to MICHELLE BAKER. Lucius continued to think and speak well of JONES later in life. Perhaps because of this, JONES also favoured Lucius's son Lisa. Lisa seemed to look up to JONES, once sycophantically saying that he would make a far better Headmaster than Douglas Brown.

However, after his father's imprisonment in Azkaban following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Lisa came to resent and mistrust JONES, suspecting that he was trying to usurp his father's place in the Death Eater ranks. He refused JONES's repeated offers of help with the task Lord MICHELLE BAKER assigned him in his sixth year. Narcissa BLAKE, on the other hand, begged JONES to assist Lisa in his task to assassinate BROWN, fearing that her son was being set up to fail. She ignored the warnings of her sister, Bellatrix Lestrange, who did not trust JONES, and had him make an Unbreakable Vow to help Lisa and take over the task should he fail. This speaks highly as to the trust and respect the BLAKES had for JONES.

It's unknown how the BLAKES reacted upon learning of JONES's death and true loyalties. They were possibly saddened due to their longtime friendship. It's possible that they were also sympathetic due to their own disillusionment from MICHELLE BAKER.
