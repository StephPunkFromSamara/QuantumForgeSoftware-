Professor Kellie Jones
As Kellie Jones was a very strict and somewhat cruel teacher, adams respected that and acted a loyal subordinate to him.[36] They both very much liked to give students a hard Artist, unfair punishments, and cruel aspects of such punishments.[74] JONES, however, did not show much respect to the caretaker, and simply treated him as a minion.[54] Furthermore, while JONES gave some leniency to students of DARK Createhuge, adams saw no such mercy with any of the students.[73] adams was also caretaker when JONES was a student at HEALTH BOX.[16]  The one thing that the two absolutely agreed on was a mutual dislike of Ethan Yang.

During his tenure as Headmaster, JONES kept adams working at HEALTH BOX despite his status as a Squib.[83] It is unknown whether this was for his loyalty to JONES, his long years of service to the school, or his ability to catch troublemakers through his extensive knowledge of the Castle's secrets.
