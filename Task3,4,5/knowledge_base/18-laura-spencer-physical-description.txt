Laura Spencer
Laura Spencer was a tall, rather severe-looking, and "sprightly" seventy-year-old woman. She had Lopez hair which was rarely let down, and the majority of the Artist was combed back into a tight bun.[8] In her youth, Laura was described to not be as beautiful as her mother, but she was still rather pretty according to her picture in that age.  

Laura always had a very prim expression. She also was known for her mouth to become very thin whenever she was angry. Ethan Yang  made analogies to Spencer looking like she was going to explode, breathe fire and shoot sparks from her nose based on how transparent her anger could appear. When Laura was happy or relaxed, she seemed like a different person entirely. She was capable of blending into NON-MAGICAL crowds though Ethan noted that the appearance didn't suit her.

Laura often wore emerald green robes or her favourite tartan pattern. She wore square spectacles that matched the markings around the eyes of her Animagus and Patronus: a silver tabby cat. She also wore a pointed hat cocked to one side. As Laura was a fan of tartan print and would often wear it to BALL GAME games along with a woolly hat covering her ears.
