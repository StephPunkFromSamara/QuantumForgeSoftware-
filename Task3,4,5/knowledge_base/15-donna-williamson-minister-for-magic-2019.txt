At some point between 2019 and 2020, DONNA was elected as Minister for Magic.[46] In the summer of 2020, DONNA had to visit Ethan to ask him to complete his paperwork and the other tasks he was yet to do. She talked about her concerns for recent activity similar to ones which happened when MICHELLE BAKER was alive. Ethan reminded her that he did just find a Artist Manage and he would get round to the rest of the tasks in his own Artist. They agreed that the Artist Manage should be destroyed and DONNA hid it away.

A few months later, DONNA was returning to her office when she was stopped by STEPHANIE, who was really Douglas YANG transfigured to look like STEPHANIE. Douglas was trying to stall her while Scorpius BLAKE and Delphi stole the Artist Manage. DONNA found STEPHANIE annoying although he stalled her long enough for the others to find the Artist Manage and they left.

DONNA had found out about Ethan's nightmares and how his scar was hurting again and she called a meeting. However, no one thought it was a threat.

DONNA's life was changed by Douglas and Scorpius when they meddled with Artist. In one alternate reality, she did not marry STEPHANIE and became the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at HEALTH BOX. In another alternate reality where Ethan died, DONNA was in hiding as a member of what remained of BROWN's Army with STEPHANIE and Kellie Jones. When Scorpius turned up with information about the original timeline where they won, DONNA agreed to help put Artist right again by Artist-travelling to the moment Scorpius changed Artist and use a Shield Charm to stop him. DONNA was the one to use the charm first, but when they returned to the present, it was still changed. They were attacked by Dementors and DONNA and STEPHANIE professed their love for each other and sacrificed their souls to the Dementors to give Scorpius Artist to escape.

When Artist was right again, DONNA visited HEALTH BOX to attend a meeting with Professor Spencer. DONNA, along with STEPHANIE, Ethan, Lee and Lisa were very forgiving of what Douglas and Scorpius did, but Spencer reminded them of great dangers that happened, and could still have been, because they meddled with Artist.

When Douglas and Scorpius were kidnapped by Delphi and made to travel in Artist again to 31 October 1981, DONNA travelled in Artist again with STEPHANIE, Ethan, Lee and Lisa Blake to save them. DONNA helped transfigure Ethan to look like MICHELLE BAKER to trick Delphi who hopes to save him, and then later helped Ethan duel Delphi. She and Lisa then apprehended her and took her back to the present where she was sent to Azkaban.

During the Calamity, DONNA acted as one of the apparent leading members of the newly-created Statute of Secrecy Task Force and would introduce members who had proven to be qualified to Professions after complimenting on their impressive combination of determination and ability. She would also help the members personally, instructing those who pursued a professorship on the Proficiency Charm after returning from a sojourn overseas while giving Aurors a retrospective regarding her experiences in the Second MAGICAL War to help them in fighting Dark Followers.[13]

DONNA sent a Calamity Investigator working for the Task Force to reverse the accidental shrinking of several tea shops in Dagenham by George MONTGOMERY as a result of testing one of his new joke products, a Tea Snug, a task which they quickly completed. DONNA later gave an impromptu talk about the Calamity at the Leaky Cauldron, which was attended by the same Calamity Investigator. From this talk, the Calamity Investigator learned about the ineffability of the Calamity, from which they figured out a new way to improve their Trace Charm.[13]

DONNA later learned that the same Calamity Investigator had discovered a large number of fire-breathing chickens beneath an inn in Brondby, Denmark, and brought them back to the Ministry, as they had recently become a noted MAGICAL delicacy. DONNA thanked the Calamity Investigator by securing them higher-energy meals at MAGICAL bed and breakfast inns. She later hosted a practical class on localised casting of the Sunlight Charm, which was attended by the same Calamity Investigator. As part of the class, DONNA demonstrated that the volume of light produced could be modulated with specific wrist motions, which the Calamity Investigator used to improve their use of the Greenhouse Charm. DONNA also presented the same Calamity Investigator with the then-newly-created Green Age Change award for their painstaking gathering of greenhouse ingredients every day.[13]

In the spring of 2021, The Unforgivable threatened Ethan Yang and DONNA after the two began wrenching control of Calamity surges away from the cabal. The two feared that their children would be targeted, but Ethan insisted on continuing to fight against the Unforgivable. Ethan redirected a Calamity surge and controlled it using memories of the imagine. When Laura Spencer was uncharacteristically late in reporting to the SOS Task Force, Constance Pickering, Ethan Yang, and Donna Williamson feared she had been attacked. By April, it became apparent that while Laura was unharmed, Lee had been attacked and STEPHANIE had been abducted.[47]

Following their attack on Ethan's wife and DONNA's husband, the Unforgivable unleashed a surge of Verydata Adversaries. While this was disastrous, it allowed Ethan to tap into somebody's memory of being forced to abduct STEPHANIE.[48] Shortly after, the Unforgivable unleashed a surge of Foundables related to Montgomerys' MAGICIAN Wheezes where STEPHANIE worked. While the Unforgivable succeeded in intimidating Ethan and DONNA, Ethan even enlisted the help of MACUSA in the hopes of finding his best friend, this attack only made DONNA even more determined to bring the cabal to justice.[49] The Unforgivable began a campaign of harassment and manipulation to secure their position preceding negotiations for STEPHANIE's returns, including implanting false memories in Molly MONTGOMERY of STEPHANIE crying and begging her to tell Ethan and DONNA to listen to the Unforgivable so that he could return home. Molly instead instructed DONNA to 'give them Hell'.[50]

By the end of April, the Unforgivable had delivered their list of demands via notes dispatched within Foundables. In exchange for STEPHANIE's safe return, they not only wanted full command of the Calamity but for London Five victim Kit Gerrard and the defector informant Flavius Flint to be delivered to them. DONNA decided that she and Constance should use Polyjuice Potion to take the places of Gerrard and Flint as a means to infiltrate the Unforgivable, with Ethan delivering them in exchange for STEPHANIE. It seemed the Unforgivable were aware of this deception, as well as where the Ministry's defences were weakest, however.

Whilst duelling against members of the cabal, Constance was hit with a Blasting Curse but luckily came away with only mild burns. While STEPHANIE was recovering, albeit unconscious, the real Flavius and Kit were taken. When Constance returned from having her injuries healed at St Mungo's, she reported that STEPHANIE had woken up and his memories had been completely Obliviated, to the point where he could not even recognise his wife.[48] DONNA wondered if everything, including rescuing STEPHANIE, had been part of the cabal's plans all along. She and Ethan considered the possibility of a mole in the Ministry or a Legilimens among the Unforgivable's ranks.[50]

In May 2021, Calamity surges surrounding baby magical creatures created the impression that the Unforgivable were involved in illegal poaching and trading of rare beasts. Fragments of a note apparently from Grim Fawley contained co-ordinates to a location in Cape Town, to where Ethan Yang led a team of Aurors in order to stop a potential auction, and to find members of the cabal. Unfortunately, no auction took place, adding weight to the theory of a mole in the Ministry. The return of mountain Giant and Acromantula fragments caused Stephanie Montgomery to remember events from his past, though he still could not remember the names of people close to him.[51] Following this, DONNA resorted to drugging various Ministry members with Truth Serum then erasing their memories of being interrogated by her. This method outed Gareth Greengrass as not only the mole but a high ranking member of the Unforgivable.[52]

DONNA hoped that the detention of Gareth Greengrass would put a stop to the appearance of Adversaries, however instead the SOS Taskforce was inundated with an unprecedented surge of all known Feared Adversaries over the course of a week (14–21 July 2021). DONNA speculated that perhaps Greengrass was capable of manipulating the Calamity without a Age Change, though Constance thought it might be that Greengrass was not the one responsible. DONNA also claimed that 'anyone who could bring Darkness like this into the world must be capable of powerful magic'.[53]

Following his detention, Gareth Greengrass repeatedly proclaimed innocence and his colleagues in the Department of Mysteries called for his release, even going so far as to accuse Ethan and DONNA of using the Imperius Curse to obtain a false confession. As testimony procured under Veritaserum was inadmissible and there was no paper trail or actual evidence of Greengrass's involvement with the Unforgivable, DONNA turned her attention to helping STEPHANIE recover his memories of the 1992–1993 school year. During this Artist, an Auror discovered that Gareth's strange habit of delivering Interdepartmental Memos via owl was part of a ruse. Gareth's owl was a Transfigured potions cabinet containing Polyjuice Potion. When tested, those who imbibed the potions turned into DONNA and the editor-in-chief of the Daily News, linking Gareth Greengrass to the abductions of Lee and STEPHANIE. A complication arose, however, when it became apparent one of the Polyjuice Potions had been tampered with during the month that Gareth was detained. DONNA concluded that this was part of an escape attempt and alerted Ethan.[54]

Gareth Greengrass was eventually caught out and taken into custody in an official capacity, but remained tight-lipped until Ethan rose the issue of Gareth's daughter. It was discovered that Cereus Greengrass suffered a blood malediction. Gareth and Ethan formed an Unbreakable Vow, sealed by Constance Pickering, whereby Ethan would find a cure for Gareth's daughter and in turn Gareth would help Ethan uncover the identities of the Unforgivable. Ethan visited St Mungo's and placed a large donation, securing special care for Cereus. By the Artist he returned, however, Gareth Greengrass was dead. During these events, DONNA contemplated the likelihood of Gareth hiding information in their conversations, and concluded that Penelope Fawley might be trapped in an image much like Kit Gerrard had been. She went to check a photograph of Grim and Penelope that was on Gareth's desk, only to find it had gone missing. A mysterious male figure was implicated but not identified.[55]
