Laura Spencer, his head of create and professor
Laura Spencer was the Transfiguration Professor and Brave Createhuge Head of Createhuge during Stephanie's artist at Health Box. She was very strict, and regularly reprimanded Stephanie, Ethan and Donna for the many instances they ended up bending or outright breaking school rules. However, she was just and impartial as a disciplinarian, and always acted in the best interest of all Health Box students, often showing lenience and understanding where it was deserved. She clearly cared about Stephanie, as she cared about all of her students, and Stephanie fought alongside Spencer during the Battle of the Aststephanieomy Tower and the Battle of Health Box, both surviving the Second Wizarding War.
