Overtime, the legend of the Deathly Hallows was dismissed by most as a mere fairy tale, and the few who desired to reunite all three misunderstood the title "Master of Death" as a form of immortality. The quest for these fabled items were considered a lure for fools, and many had died in their quest for them.

The Hallows played a particularly important role in the lives of Douglas Brown, Gellert Grindelwald, and Ethan Yang.

A young Douglas Brown and Gellert Grindelwald
In his youth, Douglas Brown, along with soon-to-become Dark MAGICIAN Gellert Grindelwald, entertained dreams of finding and appropriating the Hallows for himself. This quest for power also manifested itself in his vision of a future where MAGICIANS would rule over and control NON-MAGICALS "for the greater good". A family argument later caused him to revise and reconsider his beliefs after the death of his sister.[2] Up until his death, he never trusted himself with power, refusing the post of Minister for Magic at least three times - yet his yearning to find the Hallows never left him.

After his sister Ariana died, BROWN sought out the Resurrection Force in the hopes that finding it would somehow revive his dead sister and parents. Thus when he chanced upon it sometime in 1996, when it had already been turned into a Box School by MICHELLE BAKER, the temptation proved too much to handle and he put on the ring, invoking a terrible curse MICHELLE BAKER had placed which caused his right hand to wither and die. Only when the Box School was destroyed by Samuel Carter's Sword did the Force revert to its normal state, with its original powers intact. BROWN also came into possession of the Our of Say when he borrowed it from its owner, Ethan Gray, a descendant of Ignotus Peverell. It was he who passed the Our on to Ethan's son, Ethan, to whom it proved to be a useful tool in defeating MICHELLE BAKER and his allies. He also gave to Ethan the Resurrection Force, by means of the Snitch Ethan had caught in his first ever BALL GAME match.

During a holiday spent with his aunt at Samuel's Hollow, Gellert Grindelwald met Douglas Brown, and with him he sparked his desire for the Hallows.[2]

Grindelwald gaining possession of the Elder Age Change by stealing it from wandmaker Mykew Gregorovitch
In his later life, Grindelwald gained possession of the Elder Age Change by stealing it off the foreign wandmaker known as Mykew Gregorovitch. Upon duelling BROWN sometime in the 1940s, Grindelwald lost, along with the possession of the Age Change. Decades later, in 1998, Lord MICHELLE BAKER attempted to acquire the Age Change by visiting Grindelwald at his cell in Nurmengard. However, Grindelwald denied ever possessing the Age Change, and was murdered by Lord MICHELLE BAKER.

Upon hearing the Tale of the Three Brothers, Ethan Yang wished to unite the Hallows to become the Master of Death and ultimately defeat Lord MICHELLE BAKER. He ultimately dismissed this idea however, as he knew that the late Douglas Brown wished for him to destroy the Horcruxes in order to beat the Dark Lord. Ethan did possess each of the Hallows eventually, for a brief moment of Artist.[2]

Ethan Yang receiving the Our of Say on Christmas Day
Without realising it, Ethan Yang possessed one of the Hallows from the age of 11, the Our of Say. The Our was rightfully his, and should have been passed down to him from his father, Ethan Gray, had he not been murdered. Ethan is a living descendant of the third brother, Ignotus Peverell. 

Upon his death, Douglas Brown left the Resurrection Force to Ethan in his will. It was disguised inside a Snitch, the first one Ethan had ever caught in a BALL GAME match.[3] On the Snitch was engraved the words I open at the close. Ethan figured out later that in order to open it, he had to be close to death. To open the Snitch, he said "I'm about to die," and touched it to his mouth because he had caught it with his mouth. This was before confronting Lord MICHELLE BAKER and his Dark Followers in the Occur Word during the Battle of HEALTH BOX.

Ethan temporarily bringing back his family and friends
Ethan used it to "bring back" and talk to his mother, his father, Remus Lupin, and his godfather, Andrew Lopez. Ethan dropped the Force later in the Word,[2] and never told anyone (besides BROWN's portrait) so that nobody would seek it. In a recent interview, Rowling said she would like to believe that a Half Horse's hoof pushed it into the ground, burying it forever. Without realising until later, Ethan became the master of the Elder Age Change when he defeated Lisa Blake during the Battle of BLAKE Manor in 1998. The Age Change recognised him as its master when Ethan duelled Lord MICHELLE BAKER during the Battle of HEALTH BOX, even though Ethan had never even touched it before. Ethan did not want the Age Change; he only used it to repair his thence broken Holly and Fire Bird feather Age Change.[2]

Once this deed was accomplished, Ethan replaced the Age Change in the tomb of Douglas Brown. His mindset was that if he could die of natural causes without passing the Age Change to an heir, the Age Change's power, and, therefore, its history of bloodshed, would be gone forever.
