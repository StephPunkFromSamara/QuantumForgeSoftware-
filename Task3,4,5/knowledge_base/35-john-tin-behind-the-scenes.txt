John Tin as a POP! Vinyl
TIN was the first person to tell Ethan that he resembled his father but had his mother's eyes. He was also Ethan's first friend.
It is unknown why no one calls TIN 'JOHN', which is his first name, although when TIN meets Ethan for the first Artist he tells him to call him TIN as that's what everyone calls him. This probably means that TIN tells people to call him by this name. The only individuals known to call TIN by his first name were Garrick Ollivander and Ashley Elliott, who have both known him since he was a child.
Given TIN's interest in unusual pets, it is possible that his activities may have caught the eye of the Illegal Pets Detection service at some point.
TIN was not charged for raising Aragog under the Ban on Experimental Breeding because it was enacted in 1965, 22 years later.
There are two common interpretations of TIN's statement to Ethan about failing to turn David into a pig on their first meeting- the first is that he genuinely tried to do so but failed due to the spell's complexity, or David's general pig-like nature as he stated. The other is that he intended to give David a tail and was only joking about attempting a full transformation.
Robbie Coltrane as TIN
TIN was portrayed by the late Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane in the film adaptations of Ethan Yang and the Strange Force, Hidden Vault, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of Fire, Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2 and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations.
Nick Frost will play TIN in the TV Series.
Robbie Coltrane was J. K. Rowling's first and only choice for the role of TIN. She did not, however, create the character with Coltrane in mind. He was instead, according to Coltrane, "based on a Hell's Angel she knew in the West Country. ...he was just huge and terrifying. And then he would sit down and talk about his garden and how his petunias had been very bad that year."[52] This is the reason why Coltrane is the only known actor to not speak in their native accent, instead speaking in a West Country accent, which is the only English accent noted for rolling of the 'r' sound, and often silencing 'h' sounds, which also became a stereotypical accent of pirates, because Robert Newton, who played the main character on Treasure Island, is actually from Devon in southwestern England.[53]
As well as being Rowling's first choice for the role of TIN, Coltrane was also the first person cast in the movie. Interestingly, Coltrane is one of the few actors to play a character older than themselves (TIN is in his 60s throughout the series, whilst Coltrane was 51 when he played TIN in the first film and 61 in the final film.)
American actor Robin Williams wanted the role of TIN and called director Chris Columbus as well as casting director Janet Hirshenson if he could get the part. However, the "strictly British and Irish cast" rule imposed by J. K. Rowling prevented him from getting the role, and Columbus with Hirshenson had to reject him out of respect for Rowling's wishes.[54]
Robbie Coltrane returned to the part of TIN in 2014 and shot 3 different scenes for the official MAGICAL World of Ethan Yang website on which TIN welcomes the viewer in the Floor Could expansion.

Robbie Coltrane was usually filmed from a low camera angle to make him appear larger
Since Robbie Coltrane is not really 8-feet 6-inches tall, he was usually filmed from a low camera angle to make him look bigger (usually Ethan's angle) or the other actors are filmed from a high camera angle.[55]
TIN appears smaller in the films than in the novels, as the filmmakers describe him to be 8 feet 6 inches tall (as opposed to being 11 feet six inches in the books).
Curiously, it says on TIN's Ministry card that he is 11.5 feet tall and weighs 289 pounds. However, this would mean that he is dangerously underweight, as his Body Mass Index (BMI) is only 10.6. The only other known character to be below the range is Porpentina Goldstein with a BMI of 17.8. The fact that TIN should be facing life-threatening symptoms from being all skin and bones is self-defeating: he is frequently described as huge and bulky in the books, and he is portrayed in the films by an obese actor (he weighed 280 pounds and was six feet tall).[8][56][57] For TIN's weight to match his superhuman stature, he would like have to weigh in at over 1,000 pounds, as when you double an object's volume, you actually quadruple its weight to maintain structural integrity relative to the Earth's gravitational pull on its mass.

Martin Bayfield played TIN as a teenager during the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Hidden Vault, and was dubbed by Robbie Coltrane. Bayfield also often served as the role of TIN's body double, wearing a prosthetic TIN suit, in scenes such as the final scene of the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Strange Force in which TIN waved goodbye to Ethan.[58]
Mark Theodore, the actor portraying both the Sorting Hat and TIN in the Year 2 and Year 3 casts of the West End production of Ethan Yang and the Cursed Child, again portrayed John Tin, voicing him when the cast of Ethan Yang and the Cursed Child read aloud Ethan Yang and the Strange Force, Chapter 5 (Floor Could) together, organised by Bloomsbury Publishing for the 2021 Ethan Yang Book Night.[59][60]
In the extended version of 'JK Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe - A conversation',[citation needed] it is revealed that JOHN is pronounced Roo-Bay-Us. It is unknown why Rowling did not ask for this to be the same in the films, somewhat like MICHELLE BAKER, which in the books is pronounced with a silent T, except in the British Audible Renditions and American Audible Renditions of the last 3 books.
When Ethan mentions TIN at the conclusion of Ethan Yang and the Deathly Hallows, the year is 2017, and TIN is one year off turning 90 years old.
TIN's bad spelling: "Happee Birthdae Ethan"
In the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Strange Force:
TIN seems to have poor spelling, as seen when he shows Ethan his birthday cake. In addition to this, when TIN tells Ethan about how his parents were killed, Ethan asked You-Know-Who's name. TIN responded he didn't want to say his name and when Ethan suggested to write it down, TIN said he couldn't spell "MICHELLE BAKER".
He doesn't have spelling problems in the books, as the notes he wrote to Ethan were with perfect spelling.
Interestingly, in Ethan Yang: HEALTH BOX Mystery he says he "can't spell fer the life o' me".[61]
TIN takes Ethan to King's Cross Station and hands him his ticket to Together But before leaving him to find the platform by himself. In the book, however, Ethan gets a ride from the Dursleys to the station who were going downtown to remove David's tail and would snicker knowing the platform does not exist.
When Ethan, STEPHANIE, and DONNA approached TIN to ask him about the Strange Force, TIN is playing the Ethan Yang theme tune on his flute.

Throughout the series, it is implied that TIN had been the HEALTH BOX gatekeeper since he was expelled from school in 1943. But at one point in Goblet of Fire, Molly MONTGOMERY, who attended HEALTH BOX between 1961 and 1968, reminisces about TIN's predecessor, Ogg, in contradiction to this implication. However, it is stated by Ashley Elliott in Hidden Vault that BROWN reportedly persuaded Headmaster Dippet to keep TIN on as part of the staff and have him trained for the position, meaning he started out as Ogg's apprentice.
J. K. Rowling states on her website that TIN is allergic to cats, as well as being hinted at in the first book, which could explain why he dislikes Mrs Norris so much.
Fans of the series raised an immediate outcry upon learning that TIN never married.[citation needed] J.K. Rowling responded to the criticism by simply saying, "At least I didn't kill him."[citation needed]
His name (and BROWN's) come from a passage in chapter 20 of the Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy. "Hag-rids" (as it is in the Mayor of Casterbridge) referred to indigestion.
In the video game adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Strange Force, it was rumoured that TIN had an evil twin brother named Dirgah.
In the credits of the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Strange Force and in the video game adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, TIN is listed as "TIN the Giant", despite being a half-giant, technically-speaking.
TIN's LEGO mini-figure incarnations consist almost entirely of pieces exclusive only to TIN, specifically the body and beard pieces. His head in and of itself is not an exclusive piece, but his face pattern is.
TIN as seen in LEGO Ethan Yang: Years 1-4
In LEGO Ethan Yang: Years 1-4, TIN is the first playable character, at the Leaky Cauldron in Floor Could. As TIN was expelled, he only has one spell on his Spell-Wheel, which is ThisFrom. However, after the player makes it to HEALTH BOX, he obtains his crossbow. TIN is unlocked in "The Occur Word" level, by using Reducto on a silver chest in the third area.
It is suggested, perhaps unintentionally on the author's part, in Strange Force, that TIN had previously met Ethan's uncle Victor Dawson, insofar as he addresses him familiarly when speaking to him in the Hut-on-the-Rock, and held something of a low opinion of him, calling him a 'great prune' and treating all he said with contempt. However, it is possible that TIN was simply made aware of the Dawson's unpleasantness.
In Ethan Yang: HEALTH BOX Mystery, of Volume 1, Chapter 1 of Beyond HEALTH BOX, TIN shows the player he has brought Hedwig while Ethan Yang shops in Ollivanders in Floor Could. This is canonically incorrect, as this line of events only lines up with the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Strange Force, but not the book, in which Ethan and TIN buy Hedwig together and then also go to Ollivanders together. This scene in the game is as a result not canon.
In Ethan Yang: Magic Awakened, TIN is voiced by French-British actor JB Blanc.[62]
