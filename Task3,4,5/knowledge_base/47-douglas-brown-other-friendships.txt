During his life, BROWN became friend of many famous MAGICIANS and witches, such as Nicolas Flamel and his wife, Perenelle, Bathilda Bagshot and Griselda Marchbanks. Nicolas Flamel and Perenelle were over 650 years of age, when they agreed to destroy the Strange Force to thwart Lord MICHELLE BAKER's return. Bathilda Bagshot died a few months after BROWN, being killed by MICHELLE BAKER.
