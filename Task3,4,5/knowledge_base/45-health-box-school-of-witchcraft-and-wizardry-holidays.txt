Students could go home for certain holidays such as Christmas and Easter. The students who chose to remain were treated to a feast along with some of the faculty.[1]

When Christmas holidays ended, classes would begin again. In Ethan Yang's second year, Gilderoy Lockhart organised a Valentine's Day celebration which was not continued after he left the school.[55]

The Easter holidays were not as enjoyable as the Christmas ones, as students were overloaded with homework in preparation for their exams, which were taken at the end of the year. Students were not allowed to use magic over the summer holidays until they turned seventeen; magic was also banned in corridors.[1]
