Lavender Brown, her roommate and romantic rival
DONNA's roommates at HEALTH BOX were fellow BRAVE HOUSES Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil as well as Fay Dunbar and another girl. While Lavender and Parvati swiftly became best friends, DONNA was not very close to either of them. Although the girls did not dislike each other, they had very different interests and sometimes clashed as a result. 

For example, DONNA scorned Divination, Lavender and Parvati's favourite subject, and accidentally upset Lavender with her clumsy attempt to comfort her over the death of her rabbit.[34] DONNA was also angry with Lavender for doubting Ethan Yang's assertion that Lord MICHELLE BAKER had returned in 1995 and snapped at her about it. 

Parvati Patil, her roommate
When Lavender began dating Stephanie Montgomery, she was very upset and confided in Ethan about her feelings. Once they broke up however, DONNA chose to not display open affection towards STEPHANIE so Lavender's feelings would not get hurt. She also came to Lavender's rescue during the Battle of HEALTH BOX, blasting Fenrir Greyback away from her.[10] Unfortunately Lavender was mortally wounded by Greyback and was already dead by the Artist DONNA reached her. It can be assumed that DONNA was at least saddened by Lavenders death.

DONNA had a less tumultuous relationship with Parvati, although the two were not close. During DONNA's first year at HEALTH BOX, she hugged Parvati after Ethan caught the Snitch at a BALL GAME game. Parvati was noted to feel guilty after laughing at STEPHANIE's cruel teasing of DONNA in Transfiguration, and the two discussed DONNA's attendance of the Slug Club Christmas party with Cormac McLaggen. As Parvati looked 'positively agog' at DONNA confiding in her,[36] it can be assumed that DONNA seldom discussed personal matters with her room mates.

Cormac McLaggen
Cormac McLaggen was a Brave Createhuge student one year above DONNA. The two became acquainted in 1996 through the Slug Club, of which they were both members, though DONNA did not think highly of McLaggen. When she overheard him insulting STEPHANIE and Lee during BALL GAME try-outs, DONNA struck him with the Confundus Charm, undermining his abilities as a Keeper. 

Later in the year, when DONNA was furious with STEPHANIE for dating Lavender Brown, she decided to attend Professor Slughorn's Christmas party with McLaggen because she knew STEPHANIE despised him. McLaggen was apparently interested in DONNA, as he escorted her to the party and was very forward with her romantically while there. This, as well as his tendency to boast about himself, put DONNA off, and she soon abandoned him for the company of Ethan and Debra before leaving the party altogether to avoid him.[36] It can be assumed that the party was the end of their interaction.

Cho Chang in her fifth year
DONNA had a two sided history with Cho; while DONNA offered Ethan advice for making his relationship with Cho successful, Cho thought that DONNA's friendship with Ethan was romantic and got increasingly jealous of her since Ethan spends so much Artist with her. DONNA has no grudges for Cho however and was not angry at her when Ethan told DONNA that Cho insulted her, instead rather cross at Ethan for messing up his own relationship. When Ethan arrives at the Room of Requirement with STEPHANIE and DONNA, shortly after the Battle of HEALTH BOX all hard feelings seemed to have been forgotten or forgiven as Cho greeted DONNA in a friendly way, probably since Cho had long broke up with Ethan. The two seemed to be on neutral terms.
