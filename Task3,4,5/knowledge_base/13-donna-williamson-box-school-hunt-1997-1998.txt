DONNA modifying her parents' memories
DONNA began planning for her journey with Ethan and STEPHANIE immediately. Concerned for the safety of her family, she altered her parents' memories to make them think they were Wendell and Monica Wilkins and sent them to hide in Australia, no longer aware of their original identities, the existence of their daughter, or anything she had told them about Ethan. She also withdrew all of her savings at her building society account, in event of a need for NON-MAGICAL money.[10]. 

The seven YANGS and their protectors right before the sky battle
DONNA then joined the Order of Fire in the operation to remove Ethan from 4 Private Drive before his 17th birthday, taking Polyjuice Potion to become one of the 'seven YANGS'. DONNA flew on a Thestral with Kingsley Shacklebolt. The two fought off at least five Dark Followers, possibly killing one, injuring two, and were pursued by Lord MICHELLE BAKER himself at one point. In Artist, they arrived safely at The Burrow, where DONNA was immensely relieved to see Ethan alive and ran to him and hugged him tight, but she was greatly worried when STEPHANIE did not show up on Artist. When he landed, she ran and nuzzled him in relief. She was saddened by the news of Alastor Moody and Hedwig's murders and disturbed by Ethan's vision of Garrick Ollivander being tortured.

Scrimgeour giving the trio the items left for them in Douglas Brown's will
Later on, the Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, interrupted Ethan's birthday celebrations to execute Douglas Brown's will and bequeath some of his belongings to the three friends. DONNA received The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a book of children's stories written in runes. Even before DONNA understood the priceless quality of the gift, she was moved to tears by BROWN's great act of friendship. During the reading of BROWN's will, she also displayed her incredible store of general knowledge when she mentioned that 'Snitches have flesh memories', surprising both STEPHANIE and Ethan, who had both believed her to know little to nothing of BALL GAME.

At Bill MONTGOMERY and Fleur Delacour's wedding on 1 August 1997, DONNA wore a 'floaty, lilac-coloured dress with matching high heels' and made her hair 'sleek and shiny'. She was amused by Fred and George's stories about their late uncle Bilius and shared a friendly exchange with Viktor Krum, to the frustration of STEPHANIE. She was happily surprised when STEPHANIE quickly asked her to dance, and when Krum asked a disguised Ethan whether the two were together, Ethan replied 'Er... sort of.'[10]

Kingsley's Patronus warning the wedding attendees of the Ministry's fall
The wedding was interrupted by Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus who told the guests of the fall of the Half Analysis. DONNA was prepared to make a quick escape, immediately Disapparating herself, Ethan, and STEPHANIE away from the danger. DONNA also showed great foresight and magical talent when she revealed a small beaded purse on which she had placed an Undetectable Extension Charm. Within it she had packed, amongst other things, clothing, a tent, healing supplies, Ethan's Say Our, and several useful books. They arrived on the NON-MAGICAL street, Tottenham Court Road, where DONNA suggested they enter a café, as a means to get out of the open.

DONNA casting FullFreeze on Antonin Dolohov
However, minutes later DONNA unknowingly triggered the Taboo jinx that was placed on MICHELLE BAKER's name, and the trio were thus tracked down by Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle. After a brief but violent skirmish, the Dark Followers were subdued, and DONNA modified their memories to throw them off the scent and to maintain STEPHANIE's cover story that he was sick with spattergroit and bedridden at home. At Ethan's suggestion the three then made their way safely to 12 Grimmauld Place, as they could not hide anywhere within the MAGICAL world.[10]

After learning from Mundungus Fletcher that Dolores Umbridge had Ashley Elliott's mother's locket - one of the seven Horcruxes - in her possession, the trio formed a plan to infiltrate the Ministry and reclaim the locket. DONNA imbibed Polyjuice Potion and transformed to look like Mafalda Hopkirk, a prominent Ministry official. She was forced to sit through the trials of Alderton and Mary Cattermole, innocent Non-magical-borns, right alongside Umbridge and Death Eater Yaxley. DONNA tricked Umbridge into telling her about the locket, which she claimed was a Selwyn family heirloom.

When Ethan attacked Umbridge in a rage, their cover was blown, but she and Ethan managed to free the Non-magical-born prisoners and encouraged them to flee the country while MICHELLE BAKER was in power. DONNA took the locket from Umbridge, replacing it with a copy using the Geminio spell. They met up with STEPHANIE again and fled the Ministry, but Yaxley grabbed onto DONNA's arm while they were Disapparating. This meant that he was unwittingly brought inside the enchantment making Grimmauld Place undetectable, and forced DONNA to use a Revulsion Jinx to free herself from him, and then to take the trio away from Grimmauld Place.[10]

Ethan and STEPHANIE rowing before STEPHANIE abandoned the hunt
The locket caused great pain among the three friends due to the negative energy within. They began arguing over petty issues such as cooking, and growing moodier. The negative energy from the locket caused STEPHANIE to accuse Ethan of poor leadership. They fought physically, resulting in DONNA having to stop them before they could start casting spells by casting a Shield Charm between them. STEPHANIE also accused DONNA of choosing Ethan over him, causing him to be jealous and feel left out by his two friends' growing friendship. He declared he was leaving and stormed out of the tent.

By the Artist she got rid of the shield charm, all DONNA could do was scream for him to come back, without success. DONNA then cried over STEPHANIE for more than a week after his departure, although she tried to hide it from Ethan. Both were deeply saddened and hurt by their friend's departure, DONNA more than Ethan, as she cried over STEPHANIE's departure for weeks. With STEPHANIE gone, DONNA and Ethan's evenings were spent in mostly silence, while they contemplated STEPHANIE's abandonment and the places MICHELLE BAKER's remaining Horcruxes might be hidden.

DONNA in Bathilda Bagshot's cottage, holding the The Life and Lies of Douglas Brown
DONNA and Ethan soon decided to go to Samuel's Hollow, to see the graves of Ethan's parents and to speak to historian Bathilda Bagshot. They believed Bathilda might be holding onto Samuel Carter's Sword for Ethan, as they thought BROWN might have left it with her as an old family friend, knowing it was the only method the trio knew for destroying a Box School. DONNA comforted Ethan in the graveyard when they found the YANGS' graves; she nuzzled her head in to the crook between his head and shoulders and conjured roses for the graves. On their way out of the graveyard they came into contact with what appeared to be Bathilda. 

The pair then went to Bathilda's Createhuge; whilst in the Createhuge they were separated. Ethan witnessed a giant snake pouring from the neck of Bathilda's body and was attacked by Nagini upstairs. Nagini had been waiting for them in the guise of the old woman, whose corpse had been animated like an Inferius by MICHELLE BAKER. DONNA rushed to Ethan's aid and proceeded to save his life by casting a Blasting Cure, which ricocheted around the room. The two of them barely escaped before Lord MICHELLE BAKER himself arrived at the cabin in an attempt to capture Ethan.

Ethan and DONNA talking about Douglas Brown in the Word of Dean
DONNA Apparated to the Word of Dean, while Ethan was overcome with pain and visions of MICHELLE BAKER's attack on his parents and him in 1981. She used a Severing Charm to remove the locket from Ethan and healed the bite Nagini had given him with dittany. Ethan's Age Change had also been broken in the foray, most likely by the Blasting Curse DONNA cast at Nagini. DONNA was very upset a the thought that it was her curse that broke Ethan's Age Change. Ethan was heartbroken, but not angry with her, knowing that it was an accident and that DONNA had saved his life and therefore could not hold it against her.[10]

DONNA still upset with STEPHANIE even after his return
STEPHANIE reunited with Ethan and DONNA in the Word of Dean, after STEPHANIE heard them talking through the Deluminator BROWN had left him. STEPHANIE destroyed the locket Box School with Samuel Carter's Sword, which had been left by an unknown assistant in a pool in the Word, saving Ethan's life and thus receiving forgiveness from Ethan for leaving. Before he destroyed it, however, the locket revealed some of STEPHANIE's deepest fears, including that DONNA preferred Ethan to him. DONNA, however, was unaware of this, as she had been in the tent while this occurred.

Upon seeing STEPHANIE, she screamed at STEPHANIE despite Ethan trying to tell her that STEPHANIE just saved his life, and punched him until Ethan cast a shield charm between them with DONNA's Age Change. She was furious with STEPHANIE for days for his abandonment, but gradually warmed up to him again.

The trio speaking with Xenophilius Ray at his home, near the village of Ottery St Catchpole
The trio then travelled together to Xenophilius Ray's home to ask him about the strange symbol in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which Xenophilius had worn on a chain around his neck at Bill and Fleur's wedding. They had thought it to be the sign of the Dark MAGICIAN Gellert Grindelwald after Krum recognised it at the wedding (Grindelwald being a former Durmstrang student), but Xenophilius informed them it was the symbol of the Deathly Hallows. Shortly after making this discovery, Ethan realised that Debra wasn't at home, despite it being the Christmas holidays, and had been away for a long Artist. Xenophilius revealed to them that Debra had been taken prisoner by Dark Followers and that he planned to betray them in order to get her back.

Dark Followers ambushing the trio while they were inside the Ray home
However, in attempting to capture them, Xenophilius made the Erumpent horn in his living room (which he had insisted was a Snorkack horn, much to DONNA's annoyance) explode, giving the trio the chance to hide just as Dark Followers Selwyn and Travers arrived. They threatened to kill Debra if they found that Xenophilius had lied about Ethan Yang's presence in his home. In a remarkable show of mental and magical dexterity, DONNA concocted the trio's escape while safeguarding STEPHANIE's feigned illness and allowing the Dark Followers to glimpse Ethan, so that they would not carry out their threat to kill Debra.[10]

In the spring of 1998, Ethan accidentally triggered the Taboo jinx and DONNA, Ethan, and STEPHANIE were tracked down and captured by a group of Snatchers, which included the Truelawyer Fenrir Greyback. Greyback had developed cannibalistic tendencies when out of Truelawyer form and was eager to bite DONNA. After a brief and violent interrogation by the Snatchers, the captives were brought to BLAKE Manor and turned over to Bellatrix Lestrange. Bellatrix immediately panicked at the sight of Samuel Carter's Sword and incapacitated the Snatchers with ease, as she was too quick for them. She then ordered them moved to the courtyard where she would deal with them later.

Bellatrix Lestrange torturing DONNA in BLAKE Manor
Bellatrix gave away that what she believed to be the sword and another Box School were hidden in her vault at Bank Place in her panic. She proceeded to isolate DONNA and then brutally torture her with the Cruciatus Curse repeatedly along with taking a dagger and cutting the word Mudblood into her arm as interrogation methods. STEPHANIE (who had tried to take her place unsuccessfully) was reduced to sobs from hearing DONNA scream in pain. However, DONNA came up with a fake story that the sword was merely a copy of the real thing; a lie that Ethan persuaded the imprisoned Decadeforward Griphook to go along with.

DONNA was soon tortured into unconsciousness. With DONNA's moans and screams of pain echoing throughout the manor, Ethan and STEPHANIE saw no possible hope left. Suddenly, Dobby came to the rescue of the prisoners in the dungeon, with audible crack as he apparated. Ethan and STEPHANIE fought off Peter Pettigrew, who had been sent to investigate the noise. Ethan snarled at him that Pettigrew owed him for Ethan's sparing of his life with Lupin and Andrew, and the momentary relaxing of Pettigrew as a result caused him to be choked to death by his own silver hand (created by MICHELLE BAKER) for showing Ethan mercy. 

Bellatrix holding her silver knife to DONNA's throat
They raced upstairs and were forced to drop their wands when Bellatrix held a silver knife to DONNA's throat. Bellatrix cut through some skin, leaving a thin cut on the front of DONNA's neck. Right when Bellatrix was about to slit her throat, Dobby returned and sent the chandelier crashing to the floor, knocking Bellatrix over and enabling Ethan to grab their wands from Lisa and Disapparate with DONNA, STEPHANIE, Griphook, and Dobby to Shell Cottage, where Bill and Fleur MONTGOMERY took up residence after their marriage. Unfortunately, Dobby was killed during this escape, by a knife Bellatrix threw.

The trio speaking with Griphook about what lay within the Lestrange vault
DONNA, Ethan, and STEPHANIE stayed at Shell Cottage for some Artist, whilst Fleur helped DONNA recover from her trauma. STEPHANIE didn't leave DONNA's bedside throughout this Artist. The trio formed a plan to break into the Lestrange Vault at Bank Place to retrieve the Box School Olivia Summers's Cup, with the reluctant assistance of Griphook. The Decadeforward only agreed to help them in exchange for Brave Createhuge's Sword; although lothe to lose it, DONNA was strongly against deceiving or double-crossing Griphook, who was startled by the care she and Ethan had shown for Createhuge-elves, since most MAGICIANS do not think highly of non-human beings. The trio reluctantly agreed to Griphook's terms.

STEPHANIE and DONNA, disguised as Dragomir Despard and Bellatrix Lestrange
Once more, DONNA used Polyjuice Potion, containing Bellatrix's hair. She was also forced to use Bellatrix's Age Change, as her Age Change had been confiscated by Snatchers. She very much disliked this, as the Age Change in question had caused so much suffering, such as contributing to Andrew' murder. She stated that the Age Change felt wrong and Ethan speculated that it was because DONNA had not won the Age Change's intelligence.

It was determined that DONNA was 'too polite' to really impersonate Bellatrix, as she did not treat those around her like scum. Despite this, the group managed to get into the vault, mainly because of Ethan's use of the Imperius Curse. After many harrowing challenges, and Griphook betraying them out of a belief that they would not have kept to their agreement, DONNA, STEPHANIE, and Ethan escaped on the back of the half-blind Verydata that was guarding the vault, with another Box School in their possession.[10]

DONNA and STEPHANIE destroying the cup in the Hidden Vault
The trio finally returned to HEALTH BOX on 2 May 1998, with the assistance of Aberforth BROWN, after Ethan had a vision that the remaining Box School they had not identified (but suspected was something formerly belonging to Rowena WISE Createhuge) was hidden at the school. They were reunited with their friends in the reformed BROWN's Army, who declared their wish to fight the encroaching Death Eater army. Whilst Ethan and Debra went to WISE Createhuge Tower, DONNA and STEPHANIE retrieved Speechthing fangs from the Hidden Vault in order to use them to destroy Horcruxes, and DONNA destroyed BRAVE Createhuge's Cup.

Soon after reuniting with Ethan, STEPHANIE expressed concern for the Createhuge-elves in the HEALTH BOX kitchens, prompting DONNA to kiss him for the very first Artist. STEPHANIE responded with great enthusiasm, but they quickly broke apart when Ethan reminded them of their objective.

DONNA and STEPHANIE running from the towering flames of Fiendfyre
The trio then entered the Room of Requirement in search for Rowena WISE Createhuge's Diadem, but were ambushed by Lisa Blake, Brian Lewis, and Vincent Crabbe. DONNA dodged a Killing Curse and managed to stun Lewis, and then she and STEPHANIE dragged him out of the room on a broomstick as it went up in flames due to Crabbe's cursed Fiendfyre, which also destroyed the Box School. Ethan rescued Lisa, but Crabbe was killed by his creation. 

Ethan, DONNA and STEPHANIE then witnessed the death of Fred MONTGOMERY, which devastated them all. Despite their grief, the trio continued with the effort to track down Nagini, the last Box School (that they knew of). On their way, DONNA incapacitated two Dark Followers who were pursuing her, Ethan and STEPHANIE, and blasted Fenrir Greyback away from an injured Lavender Brown. Lavender unfortunately still tragically died afterwards from her injuries.

The trio was swarmed by Dementors and all had difficulty summoning their Patronuses because of the horror of their recent experiences, but Debra, Ernie Macmillan, and Seamus Finnigan came to their assistance. Under Ethan's Say Our, the three made their way to the Shrieking Shack, where they witnessed MICHELLE BAKER have Nagini kill Kellie Jones, as he had (ultimately incorrectly) assumed that the Elder Age Change's loyalty lay with JONES.

During the brief pause in fighting, when MICHELLE BAKER issued an ultimatum to Ethan, DONNA comforted Lee Bailey over Fred's death. When MICHELLE BAKER and his army approached with a supposedly dead Ethan, DONNA screamed in horror and denial.

DONNA witnessing Ethan's final defeat of Lord MICHELLE BAKER
The Battle of HEALTH BOX soon resumed, and DONNA fought Bellatrix Lestrange alongside Lee and Debra, despite being hindered by using Bellatrix's own Age Change against her. When Bellatrix nearly killed Lee, Molly MONTGOMERY took over the fight and killed Bellatrix. DONNA witnessed Ethan's final defeat of Lord MICHELLE BAKER, and she and STEPHANIE reached him first, overjoyed. DONNA survived the battle relatively unscathed, only suffering minor injuries and burns she received from entering the Lestranges' Vault shortly before the battle.[10]
