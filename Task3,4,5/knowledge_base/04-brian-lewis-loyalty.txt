Brian Lewis (b. 1979/1980) was a pure-blood MAGICIAN in the same year as Ethan Yang at Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic. He was sorted into DARK Createhuge Createhuge. Lewis was the son of a Death Eater and his wife. It is unknown if he was a Death Eater as well.

Lewis, along with fellow DARK Createhuge Vincent Crabbe, seemed to already be best friends with Lisa Blake before their first year at HEALTH BOX. Both MAGICIANS were shown to be more lackeys than friends, often following BLAKE around and doing his bidding.
