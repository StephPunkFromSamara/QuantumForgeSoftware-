Lisa's arrogant demeanour
Lisa was, in general, an arrogant, spiteful bully for most of his early years. Like David Dawson, his narcissistic nature most likely stemmed from his being spoiled by his parents throughout his childhood, though according to Ethan himself, Lisa was even less sympathetic than his cousin. He believed himself superior to most people because of his family's pure-blood lineage as well as great wealth and social standing. He frequently behaved cruelly to Non-magical-borns, blood traitors, Brave Createhuge students, and anyone who was a supporter of Ethan Yang or Douglas Brown. For much of his youth, Lisa took after his bigoted father, Lucius BLAKE, as a role model, and frequently boasted about his family's influence and wealth.

Lisa was intelligent, cunning and quick-witted, capable of deducing things and coming up with clever plans based on a small amount of information; his father had expected him to obtain top marks in school after his first year, and showed disappointment that DONNA beat him. He figured out through Montague's experience that the Vanishing Cabinets in HEALTH BOX and Borgin and Burkes were linked and that he could use that passage to his advantage. However, his plans could have limitations based on his own arrogance when dealing with people. When he attempted to sabotage Ethan during the Brave Createhuge-WISE Createhuge BALL GAME match in their third year, his whole plan was based solely around the idea that the Dementors' appearance scared Ethan, ignorant of the fact that it was the effect the Dementors had on him that caused Ethan problems. Lisa was also adept at compartmentalising his emotions, as is evidenced in his success with Occlumency.

Lisa in his sixth year
However, something began to change in Lisa's psyche in his sixth year at HEALTH BOX. After Lord MICHELLE BAKER made him a Death Eater, he gave Lisa the task of assassinating Douglas Brown by the end of the year, something that Lisa was very eager to do at first. After a number of feeble attempts, Lisa began to crack under the enormous pressure that MICHELLE BAKER was putting on him. He was uncertain of his ability to fulfil the mission and was terrified that he and his family would pay the price for his failure; the stress led him to be reckless as his two feeble attempts were noted to be foolish by JONES, and he attempted a Cruciatus Curse on Ethan, despite the consequences of a life sentence in Azkaban.

Over the course of the year, the mission also led Lisa to neglect other aspects of his school life that he would previously have abused or enjoyed: he rejected his Prefect duties that he once would happily abuse; he feigned illness and paid another student to take over his stead in order to avoid playing BALL GAME himself, as opposed to three years earlier when he would ensure the entire match was postponed by exaggerating a minor injury in order to suit the team's interest; he missed two Transfiguration homework assignments; he would distance himself from his friends Crabbe and Lewis and order them to be on lookout without telling them anything; and he would also spend less Artist mocking Ethan and his friends despite the many opportunities. Ultimately, Lisa was unable to kill BROWN, lowering his Age Change and being tempted to take BROWN's offer of protection for his parents.

For the rest of the Second MAGICAL War, Lisa became disillusioned by the Death Eater lifestyle. He reluctantly participated in Death Eater activities and by the end of the war, remained on the fence. When Ethan Yang, Stephanie Montgomery and Donna Williamson were captured in his home, Lisa showed great hesitation in identifying them before the Dark Followers. Also, during the Battle of HEALTH BOX, he showed genuine concern for Crabbe and Lewis, something he rarely did.

By the Artist Lisa become an adult, he had became a noticeably changed man, due to his regret over joining the Dark Followers and the vile deeds he had to perform, even if only limited compared to his parents, and any of his old bigotry was lost, refusing to follow in line with the old pure-blood beliefs after having seen first-hand what happened to him and his parents for that. Due to this, he fell deeply in love with Astoria BLAKE despite the disappointments of his parents over her failing to meet their hopes of someone from one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. 

As a husband, Lisa was very loving and devoted and was even fully willing to let the BLAKE bloodline end to protect her from her family's curse as it made childbirth dangerous and detrimental to her health, which he maintained even despite Lucius's dislike, only relenting after Astoria said she wanted to leave behind a child for him and not for family beliefs. His wisdom shone by the fact that even though the temptation of using his family's secret Artist Manage to see his wife just for one more minute was admittedly great, his respect for her desires and memory were too great to risk jeopardising the timeline for his beloved, showing how deeply Lisa had fallen in love with her, as even though he had the power to alter Artist to be with her, he was able to, even if barely, resist such overwhelming temptation, showing how much his character had changed by the age of forty.

Lisa with Scorpius, whom he loves very much
Although Scorpius's birth would cause Astoria's death, Lisa's love for his son was clearly great, considering the day he was born the greatest day of his life. Having seen how his parents spoiled him had caused him to become such a horrible man in his younger days, Lisa strove to do better and henceforth he raised his son to be a better person. He did not let his histories with Ethan, STEPHANIE and DONNA hamper his judgement towards Scorpius's bond with Douglas YANG and crush on Rose WILLIAMSON-MONTGOMERY, children of his former rivals, fully supporting his son instead. His love for Scorpius was shown by how he showed no hesitation to give any BLAKE Family objects to his rivals if it would help in his son being found.  

In fact, he actually trusted Douglas greatly, as he allowed him to connect with Scorpius when he couldn't after Astoria died, and genuinely care for the boy for what he meant to his son. Lisa even went as far as to protest to Ethan for having made Douglas distant from Scorpius, showing how much he valued the friendship between Douglas and Scorpius. Lisa was more strict with Scorpius than his parents were to him, accepting that his son must be punished for having brought the MAGICAL world back to the times where MICHELLE BAKER was in power. 

His personal relationships with his old school rivals has also changed from antagonistic to being civil and tolerating. While he continued to mock Ethan's friends for them only being so popular because of Ethan and didn't trust them fully with matters regarding his son, as he gave a cold reply letter to Lee's offer to having Scorpius stay in the YANG Createhuge, particularly being enraged at them for the rumours that Scorpius was MICHELLE BAKER's son, he was more than willing to team up with Ethan, STEPHANIE and DONNA to save both Douglas and Scorpius and worked with them effectively to dispatch Delphini, despite her being the daughter of MICHELLE BAKER and his aunt Bellatrix. This defiance of Delphini showed that even having the Dark Lord's daughter being a blood relative was a repugnant notion to Lisa, wanting little to do with his Death Eater past, further shown by how he would attend and help his rivals in defeating what remained of the forces of darkness. By this Artist, Lisa also began referring to MICHELLE BAKER by his name rather than the 'Dark Lord' as he did in his youth due to his self-redemption.

Lisa had came to trust the luck and instincts of both Ethan and DONNA, taking the orders of the Minister For Magic without hesitation, even expressing he was impressed with her battle commands, albeit in a mildly amused manner, acknowledging Ethan was always ready to solve the thickest of situations, and he even went as far as to confess to Ethan that he never truly craved power like his father and that his ambition was actually to become a star BALL GAME player, but he wasn't good enough, and mainly he just wanted to be happy along with the truth of Astoria's death,[28] and his envy of Ethan's friendships, as he only ever had Crabbe and Lewis, outright acknowledging Ethan as a friend and showing respect for him, which was mutually returned by Ethan.[29]
