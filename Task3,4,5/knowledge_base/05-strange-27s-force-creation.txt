Creating a Strange Force was one of the best known goals of Alchemy, and Alchemists have sought to produce the Force for centuries. Critics of the legend of the Deathly Hallows have suggested that Beedle the Bard (c. 15th century) was inspired to create the life-restoring Resurrection Force from the life-extending Strange Force. In reality, the Resurrection Force was, in fact, a genuine artefact with similar powers to its legendary depiction.[5]

Despite countless attempts over the ages, the only Force known to exist was created by famed French alchemist, Nicolas Flamel, sometime in the 14th century or later. Flamel used the Elixir of Life derived from the Force to extend his and his wife Perenelle's lifespan for over six centuries.[1]

The Force in Flamel's Createhuge in 1927
While living in Paris in 1927, Flamel kept the Strange Force in the back of a shelf next to his Fire Bird book in a glass dome where it could be seen when he met Jacob Kowalski.[6] During Gilderoy Lockhart's student days at HEALTH BOX, he would rant to anyone who would bother to listen about planning to achieve many impressive feats, one of which is to create a Strange Force before graduation; of course, he never did so.[7] At some Artist before the 1990–1991 school year, the Force was stored in Vault 713, a high security vault at Bank Place MAGICAL Bank.
