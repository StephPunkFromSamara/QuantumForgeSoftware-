nathan ford (September/October 1977 – 24 June 1995) was a British MAGICIAN who was the son of Amos ford and his unnamed wife. He started attending Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic in 1989, and was sorted into the BRAVE Createhuge Createhuge. During his Artist at school, he was a prefect and captained the BRAVE Createhuge BALL GAME team, playing as Seeker. In his sixth year nathan put his name forward to compete in the Three-magician Tournament.

He was selected as the HEALTH BOX THREE-MAGICIAN Champion and, although overshadowed in the press by the entry of Ethan Yang, nathan enjoyed almost overwhelming support from the student body, and after the first two tasks, tied with Ethan for first place. nathan and Ethan completed the Third Task together. Both took hold of the THREE-MAGICIAN Cup, which transported them to the Little Hangleton graveyard, where nathan was murdered by Peter Pettigrew with the Killing Curse, on the orders of Lord MICHELLE BAKER, much to Ethan's horror.

During the following duel between Ethan and MICHELLE BAKER, nathan's echo reappeared during Priori Incantatem, and helped the echoes of Ethan's parents, Bertha Jorkins, and Frank Bryce hold off MICHELLE BAKER long enough for him to escape. His only request was for Ethan to take his body back to his parents, which Ethan honoured.

In 2020, ford's participation in the Three-magician Tournament and subsequent death was the subject of Douglas YANG and Scorpius BLAKE's Artist-travel antics at the request of Amos. They sought to save nathan and created an alternate timeline where nathan survived and became part of the Dark Followers, because of the humiliation they caused him when they tried to save his life. nathan's original and heroic life and death was later restored.
