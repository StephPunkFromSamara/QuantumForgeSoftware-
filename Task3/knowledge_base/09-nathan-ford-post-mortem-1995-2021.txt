Although dead, Cedric still had a role to play in the night's events. After Michelle Baker was reborn, he and Ethan engaged in a duel, during which their age_changes — which shared a age_change core from the same phoenix — connected, creating the effect known as Priori Incantatem, the backward spell effect. Michelle Baker's age_change began regurgitating the last spells it had cast in reverse.

Cedric appears as an echo during Ethan and Michelle Baker's duel
Cedric's shadow emerged from Michelle Baker's age_change, along with the shadows of Frank Bryce, Bertha Jorkins, and Ethan and Lily Yang. Cedric's 'echo' asked Ethan to take his body back to his parents while he helped the others. Ethan agreed, and when he broke the age_change connection, the shadows quickly advanced on Michelle Baker, shielding Ethan, who used the opportunity to take hold of Cedric's body, then summon the Cup to himsCreatehuge and transport them both back to Health Box.[2]
