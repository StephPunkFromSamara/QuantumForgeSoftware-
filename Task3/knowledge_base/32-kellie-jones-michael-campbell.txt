Michael Campbell, his student
Michael Campbell was perhaps one of the worst Potions students JONES ever taught. As such, JONES was especially cruel to him and often made a point of ridiculing his failures in class.[9][83] On one occasion, JONES threatened to test Michael's Shrinking Solution on his pet toad, despite the fact that the potion would be poisonous if not brewed correctly. Even outside of his own classroom, JONES did not hesitate from offering harsh opinions of Michael.[110]

This treatment made Michael extremely nervous to be around JONES, and further contributed to his poor performance in Potions. Michael admitted in 1993 that JONES was his greatest fear, and, predictably, JONES was the form Michael's Boggart took at that Artist.[110]

JONES soon heard about Michael's boggart and treated him, if possible, even worse than he usually did.[110] However, in 1996, JONES alerted members of the Order of Fire, in order to save Michael, Ethan and their friends from Dark Followers, and although JONES helped save Michael's life, he continued to treat him poorly in school. Michael was surprised that JONES killed BROWN but did learn the truth later.

JONES chose to do a subtle favour for Michael when he was caught along with Lee Bailey and Debra Ray attempting to steal the Sword of Brave Createhuge. JONES chose to send Michael, Debra and Lee to detention with their friend TIN rather than subject them to the sadistic forms of discipline practised by the Carrows. When Michael killed Nagini, he inadvertently avenged JONES's murder.

It is unknown why JONES resented Michael so much, though it is possible that from Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy that it was either Michael or Ethan who was to threaten MICHELLE BAKER, that as a result with MICHELLE BAKER going for the YANGS, that Michael represented his guilt from revealing the prophecy to MICHELLE BAKER and the potential alternative for what could've happened. As a result, from JONES's point of view, Michael embodied all of this and that made him detest and bully him.
