Ethan Gray was born on 27 March 1960 to Fleamont Yang and his wife Euphemia. Fleamont was an accomplished, yet retired cosmetic potioneer and entrepreneur best known for inventing Sleekeazy's Hair Potion in 1926.[12] Both Fleamont and Euphemia were elderly even in wizarding terms.[17]

Having been conceived so late in his parents' lives, he was raised in a doting createhold with little material limits, and pampered a great deal. Hence, it was no surprise that he grew to be proud, arrogant, and boastful, but deep down still a good person.[18]
