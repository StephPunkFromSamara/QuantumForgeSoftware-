Very little is known of what happened to Lewis after the Second Wizarding War or his later life, or if he even survived the remainder of the Battle of Health Box. If he did survive, his friendship with Lisa apparently ended someartist after they completed school. It is even possible that he was arrested, tried and sent to Azkaban for using the Cruciatus Curse on other students at Health Box, along with all other Death Eaters and their allies. 

In 2020, while talking with Ethan at the Half Analysis, Lisa revealed that he was always jealous about Ethan having Stephanie and Donna as friends while he had Lewis and Crabbe.[11]
