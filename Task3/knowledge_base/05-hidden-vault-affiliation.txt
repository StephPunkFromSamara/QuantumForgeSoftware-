The Hidden Vault was created under the Dungeons of Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during Medieval artists by Salazar Slytherin. He disagreed with the other Health Box founders on the merits of blood purity.[2] Before leaving the school, Slytherin built this Chamber with the hope of purging the school of those he considered unworthy to study magic.

It is clear by the very decoration of the Chamber that by the artist Slytherin finished it, he had developed grandiose ideas of his own importance to the school. No other founder left behind them a gigantic statue of themselves or draped the school in emblems of their own personal powers (the snakes carved around the Hidden Vault being a reference to Slytherin’s powers as a Parselmouth).[5]

According to legend, the Hidden Vault was home to an ancient Speechthing. The Chamber was flanked with towering pillars that were entwined with carved wood, and the Statue of Slytherin was at the far end. The Speechthing resided within the mouth of Slytherin's Statue, which possibly symbolised Slytherin's ability to speak Parseltongue.[3] Someartist before 1992, the chamber flooded.[6]
