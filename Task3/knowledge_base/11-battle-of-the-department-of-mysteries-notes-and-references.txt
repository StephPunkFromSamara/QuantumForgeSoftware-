↑ Travers was at least a participant in the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Order of Fire; he was not specified to be present in the novel. In Ethan Yang and the Deathly Hallows, Kingsley Shacklebolt said Travers should be in Azkaban, and Travers escaped in the mass break-out in 1996 so it's possible he fought in this battle.
