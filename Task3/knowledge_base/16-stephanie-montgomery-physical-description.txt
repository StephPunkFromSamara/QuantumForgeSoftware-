Stephanie at age 17
Stephanie inherited the typical Montgomery family traits: fiery red hair and a freckled complexion. When he became embarrassed, his ears notably turned red. He had blue eyes, a long nose, and was described as being very tall and lanky, with big hands and feet.[12] In this way, his stature was similar to those of his older brothers Bill and Percy, rather than the heavily built Charlie, and Fred and George.[1]

His sister Lee once joked to the trio that Stephanie had a Pygmy Puff tattoo,[8] though it is doubtful that the remark had any truth in it.

By 2014, when he was at the age of 34, Rita Skeeter remarked on a Daily Prophet gossip column that his "famous ginger hair appears to be thinning slightly".[28]

By 2017, Stephanie had settled into a round middle age[56] and was later described to be getting "a bit of a gut" by his nephew, yet hiding it extremely well.[57]

He had scars from the brains which attacked him in the Thought Room in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.[58]
