Platform 9¾ was the platform from which the Health Box Express was boarded on September 1st. The platform had a sign hanging over it, reading: Health Box Express, eleven o'clock, and there was a wrought istephanie archway bearing the words Together But over the entry/exit to the platform. At the conclusion of the school year, the Health Box Express returned to King's Cross, bringing the students of Health Box back for their summer holidays. It can be assumed that the sign over the platform changes on the day the train returns from Health Box.[1]

In order for someone to get onto Platform 9¾, they had to walk directly at the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. Molly Montgomery advised that one should "do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous."[1] It is not known exactly how Muggles did not, or could not get onto the platform; however, it can be assumed that powerful magic of some sort was employed in order to keep them ignorant of its existence. However, it was shown in Kellie Jones's memories that Lily Evans's family was present at the platform as she boarded it, which could mean that Muggles were able to enter the platform, if made specifically aware of its existence.[6]
