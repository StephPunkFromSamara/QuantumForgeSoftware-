Michael Campbell, her student
Laura had a long history with the Campbell family, being allies with the Order of the Phoenix, in which Michael's parents were members. They were eventually tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange. She also had a personal relationship with Michael's grandmother, who raised him.

Spencer frequently seemed to expect more from Michael than he produced, starting with Michael's first day at Health Box when he ran out of a crowd after his toad.[3] When Michael "lost" his scrap of parchment (which was actually stolen by Crookshanks) with Brave Createhuge's passwords on them, allowing Andrew Lopez to enter the common room, Laura was furious with him.[27] She voiced pride in Michael's courage in participating in the fight with the Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries. 

Laura couldn't help but feel pity for Michael after the loss of both his parents, whom she knew and fought alongside earlier on in her career. She also sought to encourage Michael to take Charms, in his sixth year, despite his grandmother's dismissal of the subject as "soft;" Laura wanted to see Michael pursue his own talents rather than the skills his grandmother appeared to value.[29] After the Second Wizarding War, Laura may have been the one to employ Michael as the school's new Herbology professor.
