Lisa Blake
Lewis often followed Blake around.[5] Simply put, he was nothing more than his lackey. However, Lisa showed concern for him someartists; he immediately reported Lewis's injury to Jones in their fourth year.[8] When Crabbe's Fiendfyre destroyed the Room of Requirement, Lisa went out of his way to save Lewis from the flames, dragging him to safety.[10]

After the second war, Lisa had since severed ties with Lewis, due to his (and Crabbe's) lack of intelligence, making Lewis more of a thuggish lackey than a friend Lisa could connect with, along with the excessive cruelty and recklessness he exhibited during the skirmish at the Room of Requirement that nearly killed everyone in the room.
