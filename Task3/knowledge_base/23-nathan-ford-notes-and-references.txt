↑ nathan is described as a fifth year in Ethan Yang and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which means he was in his sixth year at HEALTH BOX during the 1994–1995 school year and had to have started in the 1989–1990 school year. As students have to be 11 when they start, nathan had to be born after 1 September 1977 but before 31 October 1977, as nathan had to be 17 to put his name in the Goblet of Fire.

↑ In Ethan Yang and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 24 (Rita Skeeter's Scoop), TIN tells Ethan that he hopes he wins the Three-magician Tournament as 'It'd show 'em all ... yeh don' have ter be pureblood ter do it.' implying that nathan is a pure-blood. Since nathan's parents were both MAGICIANS, he could not have been a Non-magical-born anyway.
