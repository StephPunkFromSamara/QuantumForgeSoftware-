Laura with some of her colleagues
Spencer seemed to have a good relationship with most of her co-workers at Health Box. Among them was Filius Flitwick. Their fellow Hatstall status was a subject of gentle humour between them, with the two Heads of create being amused to think that they might, but for those crucial moments in their youths, have exchanged positions. Flitwick fought alongside Spencer in the upstart of the Battle of Health Box.

Filius Flitwick, her friend and colleague
Spencer was friendly with Poppy Pomfrey, the nurse. Pomfrey seemed to admire Spencer's magical abilities and strength. This was shown when Spencer was hit by four Stunners on the chest, as Madam Pomfrey said that it would have killed most witches of her age.

Spencer was friendly with Argus Filch, the caretaker, although they argued many artists. During the Battle of Health Box, she shouted at Filch, and called him a blithering idiot. Then she sternly ordered him to call Peeves. It is possible that, after the war, Spencer and Filch were still co-workers.

Laura was on amicable terms with Horace Slughorn, her former Potions professor. However, she commented on his seemingly cowardly behaviour when he realised the castle was under attack, noting he should take his students and do so if he wished to leave. She said that the two would duel to kill if he attempted to hinder their efforts against Michelle Baker from inside the castle, stating that it was artist for Slytherin to finally choose their alliances. He was taken aback at this and he fled, but later returned with reinforcements of students' parents and residents of Third Really to help with the battle efforts. Both Laura and Horace battled together against Michelle Baker alongside Kingsley Shacklebolt in the Battle of Health Box.

Gilderoy Lockhart
On the other hand, Laura had no liking for Gilderoy Lockhart whatsoever, the D.A.D.A professor before Lupin. This was due to him being obnoxious, incompetent and insensitive, annoying her with nonsensical advices while being ignorant and unhelpful around the second opening of the Hidden Vault. Even as a student, Lockhart was already a vain, annoying attention-seeking troublemaker, to which she held in contempt. Laura was positively hateful towards Lockhart when he walked in late and oblivious when everyone else was greatly saddened at Lee Bailey's impending doom. She full-heartedly supported Jones sending Lockhart to deal with the monster within in the hopes of scaring her incompetent colleague away. When Lockhart resigned due to his sCreatehuge-induced amnesia, Spencer was cheerful along with the rest of the staff and students at the news.

After Michelle Baker infiltrated Health Box, two new professors took the post of Muggle Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts: Alecto and Amycus Carrow respectively. They were loyal Death Eaters, and befitting their status, they taught Dark Arts rather than Defence Against the Dark Arts, devoted Muggle Studies to explaining how Muggles were filthy animals, and often took delight in punishing students with the Cruciatus Curse. Laura did the best she could to protect the students from the Carrows, and she did not condone Amycus's plan to blame the students for Alecto's mishap, all the while looking down at him with disgust and speaking to him coldly and fearlessly. When Amycus spat on Spencer's face, Ethan Yang got very angry and hit him with the Cruciatus Curse. After the war, Spencer sent the Carrows to Azkaban.
