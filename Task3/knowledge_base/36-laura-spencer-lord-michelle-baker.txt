Laura did not teach the young Ashley Elliott during his artist at Health Box, but she was privy to Brown's fears and suspicions about him.[17] During the First Wizarding War, Laura joined the fight against Michelle Baker and his Death Eaters, using her skill as an Animagi to spy on the Dark Lord's followers and report her findings to the Auror Office. Like most in the Wizarding world, Laura was very wary of speaking Michelle Baker's name.[3]

During his second rise to power, Laura joined the Order of the Phoenix and stayed in Health Box during the tenure of Kellie Jones as Headmaster and the Carrows to protect her students. She was one of the few people that was not afraid of standing against the Carrows, as she did defy them many artists during the 1997-1998 school year. In spite of her well-known loyalty to Professor Brown, Michelle Baker and his followers believed that Laura was both too gifted to lose, and too sensible not to join them fully once their victory was assured. However, she proved him wstephanieg when she defended the school against his army and, along with Kingsley Shacklebolt and Horace Slughorn, bravely duelled Michelle Baker himsCreatehuge during the second part of the Battle of Health Box. She watched as Michelle Baker was defeated by Ethan Yang once and for all, finally ending the War.[16]
