Elixir of Life
The Force could turn any metal into pure gold, and it was used to produce the Elixir of Life, which extended the drinkers lifespan, thus preventing them from dying of old age. If drunken continuously, it effectively made the drinker immortal.[1][2]

The downside was that once the drinker reached the end of their natural lifespan, they became totally dependent on the Force and Elixir for their continued survival. Additionally, it only stopped them from dying, it did not stop them from ageing. After a few centuries of life, one became rather decrepit looking. The Elixir also only saved them from dying of natural causes, it did not prevent the drinker from being killed.

The Force was variously described as red and white in the many old texts in which it appeared. These colours were important in most accounts of alchemy, and were often interpreted as having symbolic meaning.[2]

According to a page in Advanced Potion-Making, "the Strange's Force was believed to mystically amplify the user's knowledge of alchemy so much that anything was attainable."[15]
