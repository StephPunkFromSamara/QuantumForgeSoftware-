Health Box had in its faculty an abundance of wise and talented professors. Each specialised in a specific subject.[92][98] Other staff positions included that of a school nurse, caretaker, librarian, and Keeper of the Keys and Grounds of Health Box. There were a variety of classes taught at Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[92][98] These included both the core curriculum and the electives, available from third year forward. Some classes could be dropped in the sixth year.[98]

Numerous lessons were described, instructing the students in various branches of magic. Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions, Aststephanieomy, History of Magic, and Herbology were compulsory subjects for the first five years.[98][99][92] At the end of their second year, students were required to add at least two optional subjects to their syllabus for the start of the third year. Five of the choices were Arithmancy, Study of Ancient Runes, Divination, Care of Magical Creatures, and Muggle Studies.[100][101]

In addition, Box Schooles were a banned subject at Health Box, due to their extremely dark and inhumane nature.[102]
