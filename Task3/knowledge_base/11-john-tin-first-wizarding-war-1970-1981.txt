TIN as a member of the original Order
Sometime in the 1970s, TIN joined the original Order of Fire. It was a secret organisation founded by Douglas Brown to oppose Lord MICHELLE BAKER and his Dark Followers. The Order was constructed after MICHELLE BAKER returned to England from abroad and started his campaign to take over the Half Analysis and persecute Muggles and Muggle-borns. 

MICHELLE BAKER's first reign of terror lasted years and turned friends against each other. It was said that during this Artist it was difficult to trust one another, as you did not know for sure who had gone over to the dark side, partly due to the Dark Followers' access to the Imperius Curse. The Order worked with the Ministry to oppose the Dark Lord and his followers, even allowing Aurors the use of Unforgivable Curses. MICHELLE BAKER also had a number of magical dark creatures under his command as well, such as giants.

TIN delivering Ethan Yang to 4 Private Drive
At the abrupt end of the First Wizarding War, Douglas Brown sent TIN to rescue a one-year-old Ethan Yang from the ruins of his Createhuge in Samuel's Hollow, after Lord MICHELLE BAKER murdered both Ethan and Mary Yang in 1981. Using Andrew Lopez's motorcycle, he brought Ethan Yang to Douglas Brown and Laura Spencer, who were waiting to deliver the boy to his only remaining family — Mary's Muggle elder sister, Patricia, and her husband Victor Dawson. TIN was very sad at the thought of Ethan and Mary Yang being dead.[7]
