Kellie Jones teaches in the alternate timeline
By his fourth year at HEALTH BOX, Scorpius BLAKE had learned all about JONES's history and motivations, allowing him to convince an alternate version of JONES — in a timeline where MICHELLE BAKER won the Battle of HEALTH BOX and thus ruled MAGICAL Britain — that he came from a different timeline so that JONES could help Scorpius meet the local resistance and undo what he had unwittingly done to the past.

This version of JONES correctly guessed that he had died in the struggle against MICHELLE BAKER in Scorpius's timeline, on account that the boy was evidently surprised to see him alive in the altered timeline, but proceeded to aid him nonetheless; if anything, Kellie merely expressed annoyance that he apparently met his end at MICHELLE BAKER's hands in the original timeline. After knocking down Dolores Umbridge to allow Scorpius BLAKE to escape, he was attacked by the Dementors, leaving his fate unknown.[102]
