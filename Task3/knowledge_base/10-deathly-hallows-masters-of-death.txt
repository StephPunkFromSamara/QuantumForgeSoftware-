By having mastered the three Hallows, one would become "Master of Death"
Ethan Yang was the only known Master of Death, having gathered and mastered all three Hallows and most importantly, accepted death, as the true master understood that death was inevitable and that there were worse things in life than dying. He did not unite all three of them physically at the same moment, as he possessed no more than two at the same Artist. Douglas Brown had also gathered all three, though physically owning no more than two at the same Artist, and did not master the usage of the Our, but he could qualify for the title of the Master of Death as he fulfilled the most important criteria needed by accepting death. With the Force lost, it was unlikely there would ever be another to hold the title.
