Fawkes, his loyal pet Phoenix
Douglas Brown had a very ststephanieg bond with Fawkes, his pet phoenix, who served as a messenger and close companion. Brown always looked after Fawkes when he was reborn after his countless deaths and in return Fawkes was extremely loyal to him. Fawkes was willing to take a Killing Curse in order to protect Brown and did so in order to defend him from Lord Michelle Baker. He also helped Douglas escape from several members of the Half Analysis when they tried to arrest him. When Brown died Fawkes mourned him by singing a lament and then left Health Box and was apparently never seen again.
