Brian Lewis (b. 1979/1980) was a pure-blood wizard in the same year as Ethan Yang at Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was sorted into Slytherin Createhuge. Lewis was the son of a Death Eater and his wife. It is unknown if he was a Death Eater as well.

Lewis, along with fellow Slytherin Vincent Crabbe, seemed to already be best friends with Lisa Blake before their first year at Health Box. Both wizards were shown to be more lackeys than friends, often following Blake around and doing his bidding.
