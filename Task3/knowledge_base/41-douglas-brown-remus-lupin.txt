Remus Lupin: his friend, former student, and former colleague
Another good friend of Brown was Remus Lupin, one of Ethan's and Andrew's dearest friends, and a true_lawyer. It was Brown who, by several special precautions, ensured that Remus was able to come to Health Box to receive a proper magical education despite his true_lawyer status. He became a member of the Order of the Phoenix after his graduation. Later on, in 1993, Brown gave him the post of teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts, a decision some considered questionable. He even helped Remus control his true_lawyer-side by having Jones brew the Wolfsbane Potion for him on a regular basis. On his part, Remus confessed that Brown's trust and exceptional kindness towards him meant everything to him, given that the vast majority of the wizarding world shunned him because of the deep prejudice towards werewolves, and Remus felt guilty for betraying this kindness by allowing his three Marauder friends illegally become Animagi and roaming wild during their schooling years. Despite this, after learning of Andrew's innocence, Brown forgave Remus for his supposed betrayal, understanding his Marauder friends only became Animagi to help Remus in his true_lawyer form and considered it an extraordinary achievement. He re-joined the Order of the Phoenix when Brown reinstated it in 1995, and they both fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, where Remus suffered a devastating loss: Andrew died in the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange. Later on, upon overhearing a conversation about Ethan's misgivings of Jones, he told Ethan that to doubt Jones would be to doubt Brown. In 1997, Remus was devastated by Brown's death after the Battle of the Aststephanieomy Tower, and later demonstrated his faith and loyalty to Brown by fighting in the Battle of Health Box.
