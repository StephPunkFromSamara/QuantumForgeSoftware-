Dolores Umbridge
As Dolores Umbridge was a sadist who enjoyed torturing students, Filch could relate to her views on a number of levels.[65] Also, as Umbridge granted Filch permission to torture misbehaving students,[67] whereas Brown would never even think of such things, he had loyalty to her.[65] He was one of the few people who actually liked her at the school.[68]

Umbridge had gone through great lengths to gain Filch's loyalty, such as giving him permission to torture, and to have Peeves dismissed, due to Filch's knowledge around the school's secret passageways being second only to the Montgomery twins.[65] Otherwise, she did have a low opinion of him, telling him not to stun some enchanted fireworks and having it explode all over the place, when it was in fact her own doing. This also showed she was unaware of him being a Squib, which is rather istephanieic given Umbridge's hatred for non-magical people.[65]
