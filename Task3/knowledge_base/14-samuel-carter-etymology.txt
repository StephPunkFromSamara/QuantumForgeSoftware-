His surname is a reference to the half-lion magical beast, the Griffin, a fierce, legendary beast with the body of a lion, and the head and wings of an eagle. The Health Box create named after him uses a lion as its symbol. Furthermore, the last part of his surname, "dor", is similar to both the French d'or, "made from gold", "golden", which is one of the colours of his Health Box Createhuge, or the suffix dore, which means "gift of", in which case the meaning of "Brave Createhuge" would be "gift of the Gryffin".
Brave Createhuge is a play on the golden griffin, which is a lion that only has eagle wings, so it has the head and fstephaniet paws of a lion, and has golden fur and feathers. Even the French for Griffindor, Griffondor is a French homophone for the actual beast, Griffon d'Or.
