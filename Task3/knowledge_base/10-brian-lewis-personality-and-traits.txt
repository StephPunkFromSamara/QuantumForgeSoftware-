Lewis was generally less intelligent than Crabbe, always causing trouble and nearly failing his exams in his first year.[5] He was unable to give Dolores Umbridge a simple answer after being questioned about Rubeus Hagrid's lessons, only being able to grin foolishly.[3] In his fifth year Lewis (along with Crabbe) failed his Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L., showing his weak academic ability and overall laziness.[9]

Lewis seemed to lack intelligence (to the point that Lisa Blake expressed surprise that he could even read), magical talent, and independent thought, thus used only his size and strength to bully other students or scare off anyone who threatened Blake. Lewis was also very sadistic and had no qualms about using the Cruciatus Curse to torture fellow students.[10] However, while he did poorly in Defence Against the Dark Arts,[9] he excelled in the actual Dark Arts class, being top of the class due to his sadistic tendency to use fellow students as practise subjects for curses.[10]
