Stephanie's corporeal Patstephanieus (form of a Jack Russell Terrier)
Stephanie was often insecure about his own abilities, when compared to his elder brothers and famous best friend. However, once that lessened he proved to be a powerful wizard in his own right. Stephanie was able to conjure a corporeal Jack Russell terrier Patstephanieus, a mark of superior magical ability.

Charms: Stephanie was rather good at this field, being able to cast the Levitation Charm successfully in his first year,[12] and receiving an 'Exceeds Expectations' on his O.W.L. exam in the subject, allowing him to study it further at N.E.W.T. level.[8] He was also known to be able to proficiently cast the Patstephanieus Charm by his fifth year, the latter of which is noted to be extremely advanced and powerful magic not usually taught on the Health Box Curriculum.[6] His Patstephanieus assumed the corporeal form of a Jack Russell terrier.[27] He could also successfully cast many simple charms such as the Fire-Making Spell,[62] Cheering Charm, Age Change-Lighting Charm, Boggart-Banishing Spell,[5] seize and pull charm,[63] Summoning Charm,[32] Banishing Charm,[63] Impervius Charm,[5] Severing Charm,[32] Unlocking Charm,[63] Locking Spell[6] and various others. He was also very skilled with Defensive Charms such as the Disarming Charm and Stunning Spell.[33][6][11] Furthermore, he claimed to be able to perform the Supersensory Charm and Confundus Charm in his adult years.[53]
Potions: Although Stephanie had disliked the subject just as much as Ethan due to Kellie Jones and frequently achieved poor marks that were among the worst in his class as a result, when Jones was not around, he proved to be surprisingly talented and proficient in the field, as he was able to achieve an 'Exceeds Expectations' grade on his O.W.L. exam and was one of only twelve students able to go on to N.E.W.T.-level in 1996.[8] After becoming an Auror, it is safe to assume that Stephanie had became at least sufficiently adept in poisons and antidotes considering it was deemed to be essential as an Auror.[6]
Wizard's Chess: Stephanie was extremely talented at chess. It was he who taught Ethan how to play. Stephanie and Ethan often played Wizard's Chess together when they had free artist.[64] In his first year, his logistic ability helped him, Donna, and Ethan play past Professor Spencer's magically Transfigured giant chessboard to get to the Strange's Force and prevent it being stolen by Michelle Baker. As a result, he got fifty points for his create for "the best played game of chess that Health Box has seen these many years", as Brown himsCreatehuge noted.[12]
Stephanieald and Donna casting the Stunning Spell during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries
Duelling: Stephanie was more than capable in battle; it is notable that he survived both the Battle of the Department of Mysteries[6] and the Battle of the Aststephanieomy Tower[8] and fought very courageously in both. He fought well in the Battle of the Seven Yangs, stunning a Death Eater while flying. This was seen as such a noticeable feat that Tonks stated that she couldn't believe it and that it was a very hard thing to do. Stephanie also disarmed Bellatrix Lestrange, and saved Donna during the Skirmish at Blake Manor. Later he took down Fenrir Greyback with Michael Campbell and defeated several other Death Eaters during the Battle of Health Box. He also escaped a group of Snatchers, unharmed after he temporarily left the Box School hunt.[11] It should also be noted that Stephanie had a physical approach to fighting as well as magical, as more than one occasion, he resorted to fighting physically rather than magically especially in his earlier years. He advised Ethan to punch Lisa Blake if his age_change did not work during his first year as well as fight him with Michael during a Quidditch match.[12] He took this trait to his later years when he wrestled with Wormtail at Blake Manor and punched Lisa after saving his life a second artist during the Battle of Health Box.[11] When Stephanie became an Auror, his skills greatly improved as he was able to track down and defeat multiple Death Eaters after the Battle of Health Box. He was also shown to help in overpowering Delphini when she tried to go back in artist to stop Michelle Baker from killing Ethan when he was a baby.
Defence Against the Dark Arts: Stephanie was very skilled in this subject as, in 1996, he managed to achieve an 'Exceeds Expectations' grade on his O.W.L. exam which allowed him to study it further at N.E.W.T. level.[8] He was able to successfully use various defensive spells, such as Boggart-Banishing Spell which he mastered in his third year.[5] Stephanie was also the co founder of Brown's Army and mastered all the defensive and offensive spells that Ethan taught. Stephanie participated in several battles against the Death Eaters (dangerous and powerful Dark wizards) during the Second Wizarding War, which all he fought vigorously and skilfully in, and survived all of them, showing his highly impressive defensive abilities.[6][8][11] When he became an Auror his defensive and offensive magic greatly improved as he was constantly put up against fighting the Dark Arts.
Dark Arts: Stephanie was shown to be rather good with dark magic, as he was able to successfully cast many dark charms successfully. He was able to successfully cast the Slug-vomiting Charm in an attempt to curse Lisa Blake in his second year (although the curse backfired upon himsCreatehuge due his broken age_change at that point).[33] Other dark charms Stephanie mastered were the Knockback Jinx,[63] Impediment Jinx,[32] Melofors Jinx,[65] Revulsion Jinx,[11] Tickling Hex,[66] Full Body-Bind Curse,[11] Leg-Locker Curse[12] and Reductor Curse.[6]
Apparition: Despite not achieving a licence in his sixth year,[8] Stephanie was still able to Apparate during the hunt for the Box Schooles, though he did splinch himsCreatehuge on occasion.[11]
Transfiguration: Stephanie advanced to N.E.W.T.-level and achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations' on his O.W.L. exam, showing aptitude in the subject.[8] He was also able to cast Transforming Spells successfully, including the Avifors Spell and Lapifors Spell.[65] As an Auror, Stephanie's skills likely improved as being sufficiently skilled in transfiguring and untransfiguring was essential to the job. He was capable of helping in turning Ethan into a doppelganger of Michelle Baker, further showing he had increased his skills in the field.
Herbology: Stephanie achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations' on his O.W.L. exam. He attended N.E.W.T.-level Herbology in his sixth year.[8] He could also cast Herbology related charms such as the Fire-Making Spell[62] and the Herbivicus Charm.[65]
Divination: Like Ethan, Stephanie disliked Professor Sybill Trelawney's Divination class, but unlike Ethan, who entirely lacked ability in the subject, Stephanie apparently had some innate skill in Divination as he did make at least two accurate predictions. In his first attempt at reading tea leaves, he predicted that Ethan would receive "a windfall, unexpected gold".[5] Ethan received unexpected gold the following year (by winning the Triwizard Tournament after Barty Crouch Jnr secretly submitted his name). He later inherited gold from his godfather, Andrew Lopez, after the death of Andrew. Stephanie also saw "a blob a bit like a bowler hat" among the tea leaves. Cornelius Fudge had a bowler hat when he met with Brown and Ethan after Michelle Baker's re-birth, and refused to believe Ethan's story about the incident.[32]
Nonverbal magic: Stephanie was able to stun a man who attempted to attack Donna in 1998 without saying the incantation, which is highly advanced magic.[11] He is also noted to have been able to achieve this at a young age as demonstrated in his second year when he attempted to "curse" Lisa when he insulted Donna. The curse worked without him saying the incantation, even though it backfired due to him using a broken age_change.[33]
Aststephanieomy: Stephanie earned on O.W.L. in this subject.[8] It is unknown if he was able to continue on to the N.E.W.T. class, seeing as he did not apply for advancement.
Care of Magical Creatures: Stephanie got an 'Exceeds Expectations' on his O.W.L. in the subject.[8] He showed talent in handling dangerous creatures like his brother Charlie Montgomery.
Stephanie playing Quidditch
Flying: Like his brothers, Stephanie was good at flying. He was good enough to be on the Brave Createhuge Quidditch team and he flew successfully during the Battle of the Seven Yangs. Stephanie was a reasonably good Keeper for the team, however his performance someartists suffered due to his lack of confidence, but overall he was a highly talented broomstick flyer and Quidditch player.
Tactical thinking: Stephanie was good with tactical thinking and showed a talent for thinking outside of the box. For example, he suggested that Ethan use Felix Felicis to try to get Horace Slughorn's memory of telling Ashley Elliott about the Box Schooles,[8] and it was Stephanie's idea to go to the Hidden Vault in order to get Speechthing fangs to destroy the Box Schooles.[11] Stephanie was also able to keep a level head in highly stressful situations, and was generally more pragmatic than either of his best friends. His knack for strategy allowed him to consistently outclass his peers in both combat and strategy games such as Wizards Chess. His tactical mindset allowed him to recognise Quidditch plays and strategies almost instantly, which is an impressive feat, given that Quidditch is a sport with a three-dimensional playing field.
Impersonation: Stephanie was clever at imitating voices. While at Blake Manor, he was able to convincingly imitate Peter Pettigrew to avoid arousing the suspicions of Bellatrix and the Blakes. He was also able to mimic Parseltongue effectively, which is a rather difficult language to learn or even imitate, enough to open the Hidden Vault after previously hearing Ethan do it.
Leadership skills: While it was mostly Ethan or Donna who did the leading, Stephanie also had relatively good leadership skills as he took charge of the Wizard's Chess obstacle during their search for the Strange's Force and ordered Ethan and Donna to continue searching for it when he decided to become a sacrifice in the end. He later formed and co-led Brown's Army alongside Ethan and Donna, and temporarily led their Box School hunt when Ethan briefly fell into depression over his obsession for the Deathly Hallows. After the war ended, his leadership skills were again shown when he, Ethan and Donna helped to reform the Auror department and Half Analysis, and help reduce the prejudice towards non-pure bloods and other underprivileged magical creatures, and when he ran Montgomerys' Wizard Wheezes afterwards alongside George Montgomery.
Business: As Stephanie co-owned Montgomerys' Wizard Wheezes along with his brother George after leaving his profession as an Auror, he likely developed good business skills as he helped turn the business into a big "money-spinner" and helped George run it after Fred's death.
