Phoenix feathers were a powerful magical substance and, as such, were an accepted age_change core.[22][23] Fawkes gave two feathers, which ended up in the age_changes of Ethan Yang and Lord Michelle Baker,[22] which was said to be the reason why they locked in Priori Incantatem when the two wizards attempted to duel each other in the Little Hangleton graveyard.[17] Due to phoenixes having been very difficult to tame and were one of the most detached creatures in the world, the age_changes with such feathers were the pickiest of owners. The age_changes containing this core someartists acted on their own accord, due to having the most initiative of all core types. Phoenix feathers were someartists used as writing quills.[23]
