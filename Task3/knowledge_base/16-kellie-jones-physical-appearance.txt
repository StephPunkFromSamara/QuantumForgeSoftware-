Kellie Jones
Kellie Jones was a thin man with sallow skin, a large, hooked nose and yellow, uneven teeth. He usually dressed in flowing lopez robes which made him resemble "an overgrown bat". He had shoulder-length, greasy lopez hair which framed his face in curtains, curling lips and dark, penetrating eyes that resembled tunnels. As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm.

The younger Jones had a "stringy, pallid look", being "round-shouldered yet angular" and with a "twitchy walk that recalled a spider", as well as "long oily hair that jumped about his face".

Jones had a ststephanieg, authoritative presence. He spoke in a soft, contained voice most of the artist, except during the occasional instances when he lost his temper.
