The Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship leaving HEALTH BOX at the end of the year, side by side
Returning to HEALTH BOX with nathan's body, Ethan was promptly whisked away from the crowds by Crouch Jnr, still in the disguise of Professor Moody. As the assembled crowd learned that nathan was dead, BROWN realised that something was amiss with Moody, since the real Moody would never have taken Ethan away from the tragic scene.[4]

In Moody's office, Crouch Jnr started to question Ethan about what had happened, and how it felt to stand in the Dark Lord's presence. Ethan, unnerved by Moody's seeming adoration of MICHELLE BAKER — something that went against everything he knew about Moody — was shortly rescued by Professors BROWN, Spencer, and JONES. Soon the effects of Crouch Jnr's Polyjuice Potion wore off, since, in the excitement, he had neglected to take it at the proper Artist to maintain his cover, and his duplicity was revealed. Under the effects of Veritaserum provided by Professor JONES, Crouch described Lord MICHELLE BAKER's plan to resurrect himself and Crouch Jnr's own involvement in getting Ethan to the graveyard.[4]

BROWN passed the information of Lord MICHELLE BAKER's return to Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, who had been acting as a judge for the Third Task. Because he had been reading Rita Skeeter's slanderous reports, Fudge insisted that he could not be back. Meanwhile, the minister had a Walllater Kiss Crouch Jnr, effectively eliminating any corroborating testimony of the Dark Lord's return. In the face of the Ministry's refusal to accept the truth, BROWN reconstituted the Order of Fire to stand against MICHELLE BAKER.[15]

Memorial for the deceased nathan ford
Despite nathan's death, Ethan was recorded as the official winner of the Tournament and given the thousand Galleons prize money; there was originally supposed to be an award ceremony, which was cancelled due to the circumstances. He attempted to give it to nathan's parents, but they refused it.[16] In the end, he gave the money to Fred and George MONTGOMERY,[16] who used it to establish Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.[16][17]

Right after Ethan's victory, two judges of the Tournament fled far away immediately. Karkaroff felt MICHELLE BAKER's return and summoning all Dark Followers, and being one who sold out many of his comrades, he abandoned the tournament's results for the sake of his life. Bagman made a bet against his Decadeforward creditors that Ethan would win the tournament, but they accounted that Ethan and nathan won together. Therefore not what Bagman wagered on, Ludo fled to avoid paying a highly increased debt that he could not afford to.[16]

Because of the Ministry's denials that Lord MICHELLE BAKER had returned, nathan's death was labelled a tragic accident.[18] The true cause would not be made public until a year later when Fudge saw MICHELLE BAKER with his own eyes.[19]

As a result of nathan's death, the Triwizard Tournament was permanently discontinued, and no further plans were made to reinstate it, despite the new safety regulations imposed, and despite the fact that his death was not a result of the competition itself.[5]
