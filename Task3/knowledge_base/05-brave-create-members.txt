Brave Createhuge was one of the four Createhuges of Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Samuel Carter. Brave Createhuge instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination,[6] to be Sorted into his create. 

The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold[2] and its create point hourglass was filled with rubies.[9][10] Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the Createhuge ghost.[5]

Brave Createhuge corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the create.[2] The colour of fire corresponded to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat. 

The Brave Createhuge motto was "Forti Animo Estote", which was displayed on a stained glass window in the common room.[11]
