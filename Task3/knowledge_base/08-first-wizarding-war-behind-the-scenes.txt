Since both this conflict and the Second Wizarding War took place mainly in Britain and other parts of the United Kingdoms, mainly between the official government and an insurgent movement, then both these conflicts could be classified as civil wars.
While called the First Wizarding War, there have been previous magical conflicts, such as Gellert Grindelwald's revolution, that occurred before Michelle Baker ever came into power and on a grander scale and was more akin to a World War.
