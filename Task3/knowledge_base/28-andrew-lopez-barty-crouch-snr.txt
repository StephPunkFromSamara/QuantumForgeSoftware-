Bartemius Crouch Senior, the man who had him imprisoned in Azkaban
Andrew had a ststephanieg grudge and hatred against Barty Crouch Snr. This was mostly because Crouch was the one responsible for sentencing him to life imprisonment in Azkaban without a trial, denying him the opportunity to appeal his frame-up, and because of his disgust about Barty Crouch Jnr. However, his hatred of Crouch didn't stop Andrew from taking Crouch seriously, for when Ethan told him about Crouch's ramblings and him vanishing afterwards, he instantly realised that Crouch was trying to warn Brown, and that the reason he vanished is because someone wanted to stop him from seeing Brown. Despite his dislike of the man, Andrew also acknowledged that Crouch had never harboured the beliefs of one who would support Lord Michelle Baker and asserting he had always been vehemently against the Dark Arts. He also was knowledgeable of Crouch's tactics to catch Death Eaters and other enemies while he was Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including using the Unforgivable Curses against them. Andrew stated that despite his disdain towards him, Crouch's principles may have been right to start off with, as they were fellow opponents against Michelle Baker at the artist, although he also said that Crouch became just as cruel and ruthless as the forces he was fighting against. Andrew also knew Crouch's demeanour well enough to be suspicious over Crouch's disappearance and the rumours of Crouch's illness, knowing that Crouch would never miss a day of work for any simple reason such as sickness. Even after Crouch's death, Andrew was still resentful of Crouch's decision to sentence him in Azkaban without a trial, commenting that he was unsure he would accept an apology from the Half Analysis even if they acknowledged Michelle Baker's return.
