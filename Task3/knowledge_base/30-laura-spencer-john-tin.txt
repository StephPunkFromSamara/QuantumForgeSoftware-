John Tin, her friend and colleague
John Tin respected Spencer. TIN was the gamekeeper, and later Care of Magical Creatures professor of HEALTH BOX. Spencer was one of the most serious professors at HEALTH BOX, and sometimes disapproved of TIN's behaviour, especially during the Sorting Ceremony. However, they were still close friends, were both members of the Order of Fire, and admired Douglas Brown.

TIN once kissed Spencer on her cheek when he had drunk very much and she was noted giving a flushed giggle in the event's festivities. When Dolores Umbridge and several Aurors from the Ministry sought to sack and exile TIN from the school grounds by force, Laura quickly flew to his aid, in turn taking four stunners simultaneously to the chest. TIN was disgusted and enraged when the Aurors stunned and injured her to the point that he attacked two of her attackers before fleeing, furiously denouncing them as cowards.

In 1997, after Douglas Brown's death, Laura stated that she appreciated TIN's opinion very much, as did BROWN. Spencer and TIN fought against Dark Followers during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of HEALTH BOX. They were among the first ones to run to congratulate Ethan after he defeated MICHELLE BAKER. They both survived the war and still taught at HEALTH BOX.
