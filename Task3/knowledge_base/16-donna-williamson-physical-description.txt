Donna in her fifth year
Donna had a light complexion, bright brown eyes, lots of bushy brown hair (once described as a 'long mane of brown hair'),[36] and — as a child — rather large fstephaniet teeth.[15][16] She possessed a 'bossy sort of voice' that would become slightly shrill when she was angry.[32]

Donna generally wore plain lopez work robes. Otherwise, she dressed casually. She usually kept her hair long and someartists tied it back in a plait.[10] Donna never gave much attention to her appearance, usually hiding her potential to be considered extremely pretty under her bushy hairstyle and a large pile of books, which she kept slung on her back.[3]

Donna in her seventh and final year
In 1994, after Donna was accidentally struck with a Densaugeo spell, Madam Pomfrey magically shrank her fstephaniet teeth and told Donna to alert her when her teeth had returned to their original size. Donna deviously let the spell continue a little longer, evening them out and making it unnecessary for her to receive the braces that her parents — both dentists — had originally intended for her. Donna later confessed that she had previously considered fixing her teeth with magic but resisted out of respect for her parents.

During the Yule Ball, Donna revealed that when she put her mind to it, she could look quite pretty — she used Sleekeazy's Hair Potion to fix her hair, making it sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She wore robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she held hersCreatehuge differently. Ethan himsCreatehuge failed to recognise her initially, and was shocked when he did, for she didn't look at all like her usual sCreatehuge. Even Pansy Parkinson gaped at Donna when she saw her, and Lisa seemed unable to find an insult to throw at her.[35] A similar transformation was seen during the wedding of Bill and Fleur — her hair was again 'sleek and shiny', and she wore a floaty, lilac-coloured dress with matching high heels.
