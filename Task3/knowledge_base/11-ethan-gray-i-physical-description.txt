Ethan before his death
Ethan was a tall, thin man with hazel eyes and untidy lopez hair that stuck up at the back.[11][10] During his Health Box years, he had an indefinable air of having been well cared for and even adored. As late as his fifth year, he started wearing glasses, though he had not in his first year.[16]

His son, Ethan, was constantly noted to look very much like him, having the same untidy hair, thin face, mouth, eyebrows, and even hands. However, as observed by Ethan in Jones's worst memory, Ethan's nose was slightly longer than his son's,[16] though this could be Jones's negative perception towards him.

In his Animagus form, Ethan was a tall and powerful red stag, large enough to subdue an adolescent true_lawyer alongside Andrew's bear-like lopez dog form.[5]
