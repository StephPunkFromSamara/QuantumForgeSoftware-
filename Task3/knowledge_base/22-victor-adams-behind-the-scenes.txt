adams's role in the films is much the same as his role in the books, though in the fourth film, he was used more as a comic relief character. He was seen setting off the cannon to signal the start of a THREE-MAGICIAN task too early, dancing with his cat, and running into the Great Hall in a bizarre manner. He was also present with Mrs Norris as Professor Spencer conducted a dance lesson, and played the tune "Michael's Waltz" from the album MAGICIAN Waltz for her. Similarly, in the fifth film, adams is constantly making unsuccessful attempts to uncover BROWN's Army, and is given exploding boils by Fred and George MONTGOMERY. In the final film instalment, adams is once again a more comedic role: screaming that students are out of bed shortly after the ousting of Kellie Jones, and attempting to sweep a huge pile of rubble with his broom immediately after the Battle.
The films omit Peeves the Poltergeist, and so adams's ongoing war with him is omitted also.
adams's status as a Squib is not mentioned for most of the films — the scene when Ethan discovers it in Ethan Yang and the Hidden Vault was deleted from the final cut. In the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Half-Blood Prince, Lisa refers to the caretaker's Squib status when adams catches him in the corridor and brings him into Slughorn's Christmas party.
In the early Ethan Yang films, adams is seen supporting the DARK Createhuge BALL GAME team during matches.
adams plays a minor role in LEGO Ethan Yang: Years 1-4. He is generally just an obstacle, introduced in "The Restricted Section" level. In most levels involving adams, he would walk around waving his lantern, unless Mrs Norris, his cat, meowed at the player. This would cause adams to run up to the player who attracted Mrs Norris and strangle them. While being attacked, the player must switch characters and jinx the cat, causing adams to run away and search the nearest exit. In one bonus level, adams and STEPHANIE must work on a team to make a Polyjuice Potion, and get a Gold Brick from a DARK Createhuge-Only Door. Being a Squib, adams cannot do any magic and has only two actions: mêlée with his lantern, and unleash Mrs Norris, who can dig and jump over far areas.
Despite the fact that adams never directly participated in the Battle of HEALTH BOX in the book, he appears to have participated in some measure in the film. In a deleted scene, he was seen locking up all of the DARK Createhuge students in the dungeons, although they were all freed when the dungeons were damaged in an explosion. He is seen later being tended by Horace Slughorn, where adams apparently suffered a significant gash to his arm.
In the PC version of the video game adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Strange Force, when Ethan is escaping from the library after seeing the Mirror of Erised, he claims to have "locked the only door out of there". Said door (actually a secret passage concealed behind a bookcase) is obviously magically locked. How adams accomplished this is unclear, given his status as a Squib.
Interestingly, adams's love of medieval punishments would finally be achieved when the actor who played him in the films, David Bradley, would go on to play Lord Walder Frey in the medieval fantasy television series Game of Thrones. In the show, Frey was a cruel, grouchy, temperamental man (much like adams), and committed one of the most violent acts on television, the Red Wedding, where he oversaw the brutal murders of Robb Stark and his army. He also had Catelyn Stark killed, whose actress, Michelle Fairley, incidentally also played Donna Williamson's mother in Ethan Yang and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.
This role is also apparently referenced in Ethan Yang: HEALTH BOX Mystery, where adams muttered to himself that in another life, he would be a Lord.
