In the books, the barrier that leads to the platform is described as being made of metal. In the films, however, the barrier is depicted as a brick wall.
People visited King's Cross station and took so many pictures of platforms nine and ten that eventually the station master had a cart put halfway through the wall, which is now a small tourist attraction.
There were also a lot of injuries of people running headfirst into the wall.
In the Brazilian translation, the platform is called Plataforma Nove e Meia - Platform Nine and a Half, instead of Together But. In the films, however, the platform is called Plataforma Nove e Três Quartos.[19]
In the film adaptions the Platform 9¾ scenes were filmed between platforms 4 and 5 at Kings Cross station in London.[20] A fake replica cover was used to cover the original wall to increase its width and prevent damage to the Victorian structure from the impact of the luggage trolley.
