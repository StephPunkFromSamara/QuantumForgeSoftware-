The Brave Createhuge common room
The entrance to the Brave Createhuge common room (which, in turn, lead to the Brave Createhuge dormitories) was located behind a large portrait of the Fat Lady in a pink silk dress. If one knew the right password to tell her, she swung open to reveal a round opening in the wall. The common room contained a lot of squashy armchairs, a fireplace, and tables.[5]  The fireplace was connected to the Floo Network, but as it was extremely public except in the dead of night,[19] Brave Createhuges usually used owls to communicate with their families instead.

There was also a notice board, for public announcements such as the date of the next Third Really weekend trip, but also for notices from individual students seeking to buy or sell secondhand books, or trade Chocolate Frog Cards, or similar, as in any school.

The common room was very comfortable, and members of the Brave Createhuge create met there for study groups, celebrations, or relaxation. The walls were lined with portraits, each one depicting a previous or current Head of Brave Createhuge Createhuge.
