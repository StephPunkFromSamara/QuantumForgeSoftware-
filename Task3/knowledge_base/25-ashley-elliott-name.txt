Ashley Elliott rearranging the letters of his name
MICHELLE BAKER was born Ashley Marvolo Elliott, a name he hated due to it being a common name. When he later learned that his father and namesake was a NON-MAGICAL, he decided to forge his own name, 'MICHELLE BAKER', from an anagram of his full name ('Ashley Marvolo Elliott' becomes 'I am Lord MICHELLE BAKER'). He used his middle name, Marvolo, to track down his magical heritage, due to it being a MAGICAL name. During this Artist, MICHELLE BAKER had adopted the name 'The Heir of DARK Createhuge' after learning about the Hidden Vault and his descent from Salazar DARK Createhuge. Using this name, he hoped to create a terrifying legacy of his own. Few people ever knew that MICHELLE BAKER's true name was 'Ashley Marvolo Elliott' to begin with.

At first, this name was used to refer to him or to address him. Later, he became so feared in the MAGICAL community that nearly everyone referred to him only as 'You-Know-Who', 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named', or 'The Dark Lord', the last one used primarily by his Dark Followers and other supporters. Fudge even wrote it to the NON-MAGICAL Prime Minister rather than saying it. According to Dark Followers, not pronouncing his name is a mark of respect. Saying his name to Dark Followers was akin to blasphemy.[43] On Potterwatch, he was called 'Chief Death Eater'. Most people either flinched, screamed or shuddered when they heard the name spoken.

Douglas Brown was one of the few who dared refer to him as 'MICHELLE BAKER', although he preferred to use the name 'Ashley', using the former in conversation, and the latter when addressing MICHELLE BAKER himself, showing his fearlessness. In ignoring the name MICHELLE BAKER, BROWN disallowed him the intimidation he sought while appealing to what little remained of his former student deep within MICHELLE BAKER. BROWN also insists on others to use the name 'MICHELLE BAKER', rather than 'You-Know-Who', or such varieties, believing that fear in the name would only increase fear of the thing itself.[5][44] Despite this, however, there were those, such as Kellie Jones and John Tin, who believed that only BROWN was worthy of using the name, and expressed disapproval or even anger when anyone else did so, even Ethan Yang, the one who apparently defeated MICHELLE BAKER in 1981 and the one prophesised to be the one who can defeat MICHELLE BAKER for good.[45][46] Much later, Ethan, despite never fearing MICHELLE BAKER in name, would use the name 'Elliott' in their final confrontation, for the same reasons BROWN did. The few other known people who were fearlessly willing to use the name MICHELLE BAKER aloud were Remus Lupin,[47] Andrew Lopez[48] and Merula Snyde. MICHELLE BAKER would hate it when people dared call him by his forsaken name.

After the coup at the Ministry in 1997, the Taboo was placed on the name 'MICHELLE BAKER'; speaking the name would summon Dark Followers, Ministry officials, or Snatchers via Apparition. This was used to find those who opposed MICHELLE BAKER's rule, as only they would dare speak the name. This was how Ethan, STEPHANIE and DONNA were found at Tottenham Court Road and before being brought to BLAKE Manor. Also, Kingsley Shacklebolt barely escaped Dark Followers when he spoke it.[27]

After MICHELLE BAKER's demise at the Battle of HEALTH BOX, it would appear that the MAGICAL world at large would no longer fear in speaking his name aloud, as Lisa Blake was one of such people. This could be due to the growth of literature and research about his life and heritage, with one book titled Marvolo: The Truth. One reason why the author gave the book that title was to reveal to the MAGICAL public the connection between 'Lord MICHELLE BAKER' and his undignified grandfather Marvolo Gaunt, thereby depriving MICHELLE BAKER of the climate of fear and mystery that he had spent much of his life creating around himself. It could also be that his death was confirmed by thousands of witnesses, unlike his first downfall that only an infant Ethan ever witnessed.
