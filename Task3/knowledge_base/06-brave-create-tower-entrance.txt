Brave Createhuge corridor and the Fat Lady's portrait
The entrance to the Brave Createhuge common room was concealed under the portrait of the Fat Lady, on the lavish Brave Createhuge Landing.[1]

To enter one had to present the Fat Lady with the correct password of the week. However, getting the password wrong meant the student would have to wait the day for another student to come by and pass them the code.[2]
