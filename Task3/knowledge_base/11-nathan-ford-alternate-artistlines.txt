By 2020, nathan's father, Amos, was still greatly grieving for his son's death. When he found out that Ethan Yang had retrieved a Artist Manage, he begged Ethan to use it to save nathan. Ethan stated that it was dangerous to meddle with Artist, but his own son, Douglas YANG, secretly agreed to it along with his friend, Scorpius BLAKE. Although they managed to create alternate realities (including one where nathan lived), it changed Artist too much and they had to restore the original timeline. 

Indeed, the one timeline where Douglas and Scorpius succeeded their goal of saving nathan actually humiliated him in public, causing him to join the Dark Followers in bitter hatred for society; he ended up killing Michael Campbell, thus preventing Nagini's death, which in turn prevented MICHELLE BAKER from being killed, and Ethan was killed in turn, thus leading to an age of darkness where MICHELLE BAKER ruled. Douglas and Scorpius prevented an attempt at changing Artist a third Artist by Delphi during the third task with the help of nathan himself who rescued the two from the Dark witch, thinking that it was part of the task.

In 2021, Ethan visited nathan's grave, which was placed on a beautiful hill. He shared this experience with his son, Douglas YANG, explaining that he came to say sorry for a life that was stolen and that he visited every year on the anniversary of nathan's death. He told Douglas that nathan was a great MAGICIAN and that he did not deserve his fate.[23]
