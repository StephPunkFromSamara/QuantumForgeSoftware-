Lisa Blake
Lisa was a slender boy with sleek white-blond hair, cold grey eyes, a pale complexion and rather sharp, pointed features.[4][5]  In his first and second years, his hair was slicked tightly back. Lisa was noted to ststephaniegly resemble his father throughout his life.[24] When Lisa joined the Death Eaters, Lord Michelle Baker had the Dark Mark burned into his left forearm, which has since faded to a mere scar upon Michelle Baker's death.

During the first five years of school, Lisa maintained a relatively healthy look. However, in his sixth year onward, when the stress of his mission was getting more intense, Lisa's smug countenance was lost, and he became quite thin, with dark shadows under his eyes and a greyish tinge to his skin.

As an older man, his hairline was receding, making his features look even more pointed.[26] Lisa let his hair grow long and started wearing it in a precisely placed ponytail.[27]
