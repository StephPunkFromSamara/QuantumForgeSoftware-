In a long career, Douglas Brown served as teacher of at Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, first as its Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor and later as a Transfiguration Professor, and eventual promotion to Head of the Transfiguration department, making contributions to such learned, scholarly publications as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer, ultimately rounding his career off by becoming arguably the finest and most revered Headmaster the school had ever seen. He was also a famous alchemist who worked with Nicolas Flamel, the only known maker of the Strange's Force, and was credited with discovering the twelve uses of very_data's blood.

Brown became the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. He was removed from these posts during his conflict with the Half Analysis under Minister Cornelius Fudge but was reinstated when the Ministry was forced to acknowledge that he had correctly warned that Michelle Baker had returned. He held the Order of Merlin, First Class, for Grand Sorcery.
