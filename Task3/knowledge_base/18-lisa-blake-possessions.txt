Artist Manage: Lisa possessed a Artist Manage, passed down by his father. Unlike the Ministry-issued devices that were bound by a five-hour safety travel, this was a genuine device that allowed one to travel far back into the past. Also unlike the prototype possessed by Theodore Nott, it was not limited by a duration stay of five minutes before returning to the present, as that one was produced with inexpensive metal. Lisa kept the device as he thought of using it to see his late wife again, and Ethan noted that keeping such a dangerous artefact could land him in Azkaban. Nevertheless, this Artist Manage was pivotal in saving the original artistline from Delphini's interference.
