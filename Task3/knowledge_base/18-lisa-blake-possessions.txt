Age Change: Lisa's Age Change was 10" long, made of hawthorn wood, and had a One Horn hair core. The Age Change was manufactured by Garrick Ollivander and was described by him as being 'reasonably pliant'.
Comet 260: Lisa owned this model of broomstick, which he owned prior to starting his first year.
Cloud 2001: Lisa's father bought the entire DARK Createhuge BALL GAME team Cloud 2001s in exchange for his son being played as Seeker.
DARK Createhuge tie pin: Like other DARK HOUSES, Lisa owned a tie pin in the shape of a serpent of DARK Createhuge Createhuge, to show his pride for his Createhuge. He wore this throughout his years at HEALTH BOX.[30]
DARK Createhuge ring: Likewise, he also possessed an heirloom ring embossed with a serpent.[30]
Dress robes: Lisa wore dress robes while attending the Yule Ball with Pansy Parkinson in 1994.
Eagle owl: Lisa owned an eagle owl, or Bubo bubo. During BLAKE's first year at HEALTH BOX School, the owl delivered daily packages of sweets from his mother.[31]
Prefect badge: Lisa owned a DARK Createhuge Prefect badge, which he gained after becoming a Prefect in 1995.
YANG Stinks badge: Lisa owned one these enchanted badges during the Three-magician Tournament, for the purpose of mocking Ethan Yang.
Inquisitorial Squad Badge: Lisa was granted a badge by Dolores Umbridge to show his membership of the Inquisitorial Squad in his fifth year.[32]
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder: Lisa possessed some of this magical, darkness creating powder sold by Montgomerys' MAGICIAN Wheezes, which he used in 1997 to smuggle Dark Followers into HEALTH BOX castle.
Hand of Glory: Lisa bought the Hand of Glory from Borgin and Burkes sometime after the end of his second year and before the start of his sixth, he used it to guide himself and the rest of the Dark Followers outside the Room of Requirement after he used the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
Artist Manage: Lisa possessed a Artist Manage, passed down by his father. Unlike the Ministry-issued devices that were bound by a five-hour safety travel, this was a genuine device that allowed one to travel far back into the past. Also unlike the prototype possessed by Theodore Nott, it was not limited by a duration stay of five minutes before returning to the present, as that one was produced with inexpensive metal. Lisa kept the device as he thought of using it to see his late wife again, and Ethan noted that keeping such a dangerous artefact could land him in Azkaban. Nevertheless, this Artist Manage was pivotal in saving the original timeline from Delphini's interference.
