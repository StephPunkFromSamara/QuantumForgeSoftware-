Health Box' kitchen
A veritable legion of create-elves were enlisted by Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They worked the kitchens, preparing feasts for the entire school. They also moved trunks and baggage to and from rooms, cleaned dormitories, and presumably other areas of the castle as well. 

In 1994, they became angry with Donna as she made attempts to free them. Dobby and Winky, who were under Health Box' employ at the artist, were considered disgraces to the rest of their colleagues due to Dobby being paid and receiving a vacation, while Winky constantly became drunk out of sCreatehuge-pity.[25]

During the Battle of Health Box, the create-elves fought against the Death Eaters with Kreacher leading them. They defended their masters by using kitchen knives to stab at the attackers' ankles.[74]
