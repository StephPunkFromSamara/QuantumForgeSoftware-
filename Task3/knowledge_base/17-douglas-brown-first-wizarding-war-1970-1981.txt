Some of the members of the original Order of Fire
After Lord MICHELLE BAKER started his first rise to power in 1970, BROWN, around whom opposition to the Dark Lord had always rallied,[62] founded and led the Order of Fire, a secret society willing to risk their lives to fight Lord MICHELLE BAKER and his Dark Followers. And despite the fact that the group suffered heavy losses during the conflict, it was also a significant contributor to the war effort. Throughout BROWN's efforts to undermine the Dark Lord's rise to power, a great many witches and wizards passed through the halls of HEALTH BOX: Some of these became staunchly loyal to him and what he stood for, whereas others would become enemies, allying themselves with Lord MICHELLE BAKER. Among these students were future Order members Arthur MONTGOMERY and Molly Prewett, Dark Followers-to-be Bellatrix Lopez and Lucius BLAKE.

Later on in the war,  BROWN discovered that a former Ministry employee by the name of Antoine Grimalkin and his wife Bedilia had joined the ranks of Lord MICHELLE BAKER's followers. Once a respected researcher, Antoine had departed the Ministry after his experimental work was deemed too dangerous, and the couple had since turned their skills towards Dark magic. Among their inventions was the Frequensting, a variant of the Stinging Hex that was designed to produce a relentless mental torment in its victims. Operating from their home in Samuel’s Hollow, the pair would travel between wizarding communities, deploying their curse through a bewitched gramophone - a curious blending of Muggle technology and the Dark Arts - which allowed the spell to spread across wide areas. The resulting havoc rendered many victims incapacitated and sowed panic among the population.  Realising the gravity of their threat, BROWN intervened discreetly, providing key intelligence that ultimately led the Ministry to their location. His efforts were instrumental in Antoine’s capture and the dismantling of the couple’s operations. Antoine was later confined to Azkaban, although his wife evade arrest and fled abroad.[63]

Sometime after this, BROWN was approached by another person who also wanted a job at HEALTH BOX: Sybill Trelawney, who applied to become the new professor of Divination, a subject BROWN disliked and barely considered a part of necessary education for young wizards and witches. BROWN gave her a chance because she was the great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney. To his disappointment, when he was interviewing Sybill at the Hog's Head, he came to the conclusion that she was not a real Seer. However, as BROWN was about to leave, Trelawney fell into a real trance and made a prophecy about the birth of the one that would have the power to vanquish the Dark Lord, who would be born to those "who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies".[64] This astonished BROWN, but as it turned out, the Death Eater Kellie Jones had overheard most of the prophecy but had been caught in the act of spying and ejected from the tavern by Aberforth BROWN.[48] BROWN hired Trelawney in order to protect her from the Dark Followers.

Jacob in his room
No sooner had Rakepick completed her tutelage and left her school days behind, however, before her spiritual successor arrived to begin his own. Over the course of his school career, young Jacob earned a steadily increasing notoriety by not only having picked up where she had left off, but even succeeding where she failed; a feat he accomplished with the help of two of his classmates, Duncan Ashe and Olivia Green of DARK Createhuge and WISE Createhuge Createhuge, respectively.[65] Between the latter's arrival in 1974 and his eventual banishment from the castle in 1980, not only had this trio of friends managed to penetrate one of the oldest and most dangerous secrets that the ancient castle, but they had also broken countless school rules and inadvertently endangered their peers by tampering with the vaults by unleashing a myriad devastating curses upon the school. This did not, however, discourage the Headmaster from taking a personal interest in Jacob, who was both one of the most rebellious and most talented students at the Artist.[66]

Having sensed his underlying decency of instinct despite his disregard for the school rules and, more importantly, fully recongised that there had been no malintent on his part when he accidentally triggered the safeguards of the vaults, BROWN was very lenient with the boy. Even so, he still kept a close eye on him and had even gone to some lengths to help him, which included giving him private lessons to help him nurture his gift as a born Legilimens. He did not, however, condone their continued fixation with the Cursed Vaults; particularly in the case of Jacob himself, who eventually grew dangerously obsessive with opening all of the vaults. Having grown concerned that this fixation might even drive him mad, and finally unable to overlook their pursuit for the vaults for these reasons, he was known to have reprimanded both Jacob and Mr Ashe for their many indiscretions on at least one occasion.[67]

Despite his best efforts to help Jacob, however, and even though BROWN and the rest of the staff ultimately got the situation under control, their hunt for the vaults ended in tragedy when Duncan Ashe was killed while attempting to brew a particularly potent Erumpent Potion in an effort to get past one of the obstacles standing between them and one of the Cursed Vaults. Neither the first, nor the last casualty at the school as a result of Jacob's extra-curricular activities, Olivia Green also endured hardships as a result.[68] With the death of a student on their hands as a direct result of their search for the vaults, BROWN notified the Half Analysis about Duncan's untimely demise, at which point two Aurors were sent to bring Jacob in for questioning. Having found him at the Three Broomsticks Inn, they promptly "grabbed him by the hood of his robes and dragged him out the door".[69]

Having been informed of Jacob's subsequent confession that he had pressured his friend into making the potion as part of their bid for the vaults,[68] BROWN had no other choice but to expel him from the school.[70] And even though Jacob's removal was prominently covered at the Artist in the Daily News,[71] the faculty still denied any knowledge that the vaults' existence, both to dissuade students from pursuing them, and to prevent the Ministry and concerned parents from inserting themselves into HEALTH BOX affairs.[72]

Several months after BROWN was forced to terminate his enrolment, however, not only did word reach him that Jacob had ran away from home and, rumours had it, earned notoriety in the figurative underworld as the "most feared wizard in Knockturn Could";[68] which led to the misconception that he had even become a follower of Lord MICHELLE BAKER.[73] After a subsequent discussion with the late Duncan Ashe, however, who had returned as a ghost following his unfortunate passing, not only was it established beyond any reasonable doubt that Jacob had never been Death Eater material, but more importantly, the Headmaster learned about the horrible truth behind the highly significant and mitigating circumstances surrounding Jacob's obsession with the vaults, as well as the part he had played in the events that had led up to his expulsion from the school in the first place.[68]

Throughout their attendance at HEALTH BOX, Jacob, Duncan and Olivia had all been on the receiving end of a series of threatening messages from a secret society of Dark witches and wizards calling itself The Cabal, which had coerced them into becoming unwilling pawns in the group's bid for the Cursed Vaults by informing them that failure to cooperate would have meant their deaths.[68] Their involvement had been a covert one indeed, as not only had all of this taken place right under the noses of BROWN and the rest of the faculty, but it had even been sulte enough that Jacob's search for the vaults had seemed, to the castle's other inhabitants, like nothing more the self-seeking exploit of a reckless youth.[74] Only then was BROWN made aware that the true driving force behind Jacob's obsession with was his love for his family.[68]

Even under duress, Jacob had actually gone to some lengths to try and protect the school, and defied the group by moving all of their research into the vaults from the Boathouse - where he and his accomplices had been holding secret meetings while they were still under R's heel[75] - to a new home in order to hide it from them.[76] In response to which The Cabal had raised the stakes and threatened to make his mother and his younger sibling "disappear" if he refused to cooperate. This effectively forced Jacob's compliance, and explained his urgency with which he pursued the Cursed Vaults in the later parts of his education. Jacob had even taken the blame for the very potion that it in truth had been The Cabal that had forced Duncan to make, as he feared that they would go after his family had he tried to expose them.[68]

Even though BROWN was fully prepared to take the mitigating circumstances of Jacob's transgressions into account going forward, any decision the Headmaster might have meant to make about revoking Jacob's expulsion or help to fight The Cabal ultimately became rather inappreciable when Jacob went mysteriously missing shortly thereafter.[70] With Jacob gone and unable to protect his kin, and given the possibility that The Cabal - whose members were still unknown and very much at large - might make good on their threats had he began to move against them prematurely, BROWN kept most of his findings to himself. As such, there were only three people who knew the full story once the dust had settled: Jacob, Duncan Ashe, and the Headmaster himself.[68] Certain that HEALTH BOX had not seen the last of The Cabal, however, he tasked his old friend, veteran Auror and brother-in-arms in the Order of Fire, Alastor Moody, with investigating The Cabal, who henceforth monitored their activities off-the-books.[77][78][79]
