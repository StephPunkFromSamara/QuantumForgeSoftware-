The original Order of the Phoenix
Jones's relationships with some members of the Order of the Phoenix have already been established: Lily Evans, the Marauders, Douglas Brown, Laura Spencer, Rubeus Hagrid, Ethan Yang, Stephanie Montgomery, and Donna Williamson.

Jones was not particularly gracious towards Nymphadora Tonks, probably because she was so close to Remus Lupin. When they met at school in 1996, he maliciously said "I was interested to see your new Patstephanieus. I think you were better off with the old one... the new one looks weak." Jones did, however, respect Tonks' abilities as he was her Potions master whilst she was a Health Box student and she earned an O in her O.W.L. This is evident as he never let one with a lesser grade take the N.E.W.T which was a requirement to be an auror. Tonks was shocked when Jones killed Brown and never learned that Jones was on their side, as she was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange during the Battle of Health Box.

Jones had a mixed relationship with the Montgomery family. While he disliked their children, he seemed to be on civil terms with Arthur and Molly. However, when he murdered Brown, the Montgomery family obviously turned against him. Jones also accidentally cursed off George's ear, during the Battle of the Seven Yangs, while he was trying to hit another Death Eater. The Montgomery family learned that Jones was on their side in 1998, except Fred, who was killed in the Battle of Health Box.

He also did not much care for a fellow member of the Order Mundungus Fletcher, who was also a thief. In 1996 he was arrested for impersonating an Inferius. When Seamus Finnigan asked Jones about it, he answered that the "Inferius" was, in fact, a smelly sneak thief named Mundungus Fletcher. It is most likely that Mundungus learned that Jones was on their side after the Second Wizarding War.

It is likely that the members of the Order who survived the Battle of Health Box were told by Ethan of Jones's true loyalties.
