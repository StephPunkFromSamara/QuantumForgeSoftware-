Ashley Elliott
TIN was two years below Ashley Elliott at HEALTH BOX, and in TIN's third year, Elliott opened the Hidden Vault, unleashing a Speechthing on Non-magical-born students. After the death of Myrtle Warren, HEALTH BOX was in danger of closing, and to prevent that happening, Elliott framed TIN and his pet Acromantula, Aragog, for the crime. TIN protected Aragog from Elliott, throwing him to the ground when he tried to curse Aragog, making TIN the only person to challenge Elliott while he was a student. Despite this, TIN was expelled from HEALTH BOX and had his Age Change snapped in half by the Half Analysis.[19] Believing in TIN's innocence, however, Professor Douglas Brown convinced then-Headmaster Armando Dippet to allow TIN to stay on at HEALTH BOX as gamekeeper.

Ashley Elliott never felt remorse for framing TIN and ruining his life. As Elliott went on to become Lord MICHELLE BAKER, TIN joined the Order of Fire to fight against MICHELLE BAKER and his Dark Followers. In 1981, TIN was devastated by the murder of his friends Ethan and Mary Yang but was relieved when the Dark Lord disappeared after failing to kill young Ethan Yang. Although many thought that MICHELLE BAKER was dead, TIN, agreeing with BROWN, believed that he would return one day, as he believed that he did not "have enough human left in him to die". As with most of the MAGICAL community, he refused to speak MICHELLE BAKER's name, and generally referred to him as "You-Know-Who." However, when he first explained MICHELLE BAKER's background to Ethan, he reluctantly said MICHELLE BAKER's name. When MICHELLE BAKER was searching for the Strange Force, he took advantage of TIN's love and knowledge of magical creatures and through Quirinus Quirrell, gathered the secret of subduing Fluffy through music from a drunken TIN, who was remorseful afterwards. Since MICHELLE BAKER had a certain respect for Hogwart's professors, it is not known if that included TIN, who taught Care of Magical Creatures. This is unlikely considering TIN's half-giant status.

In 1995, after his resurrection, MICHELLE BAKER dispatched his Dark Followers to convince the giants to join their side, while BROWN had sent TIN and Olympe Maxime to do the same. While TIN and Maxime were on good terms with the Gurg, Karkus, the Dark Followers supported the giant Golgomath in an uprising that resulted in Golgomath beheading Karkus and taking over the giant colony. The giants then attacked TIN and Maxime, who were forced to retreat.

In 1998, TIN fought in the Battle of HEALTH BOX and was captured by the Dark Followers. After Ethan sacrificed himself to be killed, MICHELLE BAKER ordered a grieving TIN to carry his friend's "dead" body in his arms, where it would be clearly visible to Ethan's supporters. On the way back to the school, TIN expressed his fury with the centaurs for staying out of the fight, prompting them to join in soon after.[33] TIN was among the first to congratulate Ethan after his defeat of MICHELLE BAKER, showing his disdain for the Dark Lord.

Although TIN's expulsion, and much of his later reputation for clumsiness, was originally Ashley Elliott's fault, Elliott at least did not attach any special importance to his relationship with TIN, and at the Battle of HEALTH BOX, made no mention of their past. TIN, in turn, is never seen to admit to having known Elliott in their youth, and never referred to him except as 'You-Know-Who', or (once) by his preferred alias of MICHELLE BAKER; indeed, TIN is terrified of him in the Battle of the Seven YANGS, in spite of having known him. It was never confirmed if he ever knew that his former classmate and the Dark Lord were one and the same; however, since TIN said to Ethan in 1991 that MICHELLE BAKER was in DARK Createhuge, it is likely that TIN knew.
