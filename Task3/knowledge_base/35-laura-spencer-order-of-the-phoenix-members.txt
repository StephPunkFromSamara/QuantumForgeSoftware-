The original Order of the Phoenix
Spencer had a good relationship with most members of the Order of the Phoenix. Some of them included Nymphadora Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt, whom she appeared to be friendly with Kingsley. They fought Michelle Baker, along with Horace Slughorn, and all of them survived the war. 

Other fellow member was Alastor Moody, who was appointed as DADA professor in 1994. However, he was captured by Barty Crouch Jnr and Peter Pettigrew; Barty Crouch was disguised as Moody and became the professor, as he wanted to send Ethan Yang to Michelle Baker. Spencer was very angry by Crouch's teaching methods and shouted at him. It is possible that she had the same opinion of the real Moody, but Moody might have been friendly with Spencer afterwards. He was killed by Michelle Baker during the Battle of the Seven Yangs.
