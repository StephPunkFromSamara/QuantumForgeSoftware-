Douglas Brown, his dear friend
Douglas Brown placed great trust in Hagrid, which Hagrid returned with fierce loyalty and unwavering admiration. This loyalty always flared up whenever someone insulted Brown, one artist causing Hagrid to give Dudley Dursley a pig's tail, and causing him to choke Igor Karkaroff another artist. Hagrid would often describe Brown as a "great man".

While a professor, Brown believed in Hagrid's innocence when he was accused of opening the Hidden Vault, and convinced then-Headmaster Armando Dippet to train Hagrid as the Gamekeeper and allow him to remain at Health Box.[19] Hagrid went on to join Brown's Order of the Phoenix as an adult, and he was the one tasked with bringing Ethan Yang to Brown after Ethan and Lily Yang were murdered in 1981. 

Brown also trusted him to move the Strange's Force from Gringotts Wizarding Bank to the school and believed Hagrid could offer Ethan as much protection as "a bunch" of Ministry Aurors could while shopping in Floor Could, in 1996.[32] In 1995, Brown gave Hagrid the difficult task of approaching the giant colonies of the North and dissuading them joining forces with Lord Michelle Baker, knowing Hagrid was fully capable of the delicate handling required to court the Gurg.[20]

Brown additionally was the only one who supported Hagrid's decision to bring his giant half-brother Grawp with him back to Health Box after his mission to recruit the giants failed, allowing Grawp to stay in the Occur Word and later having him sent to the mountains near Third Really. After Douglas Brown's death, Hagrid was so devastated to the point that he was inconsolable, despite the best efforts of Olympe Maxime and even his half-brother Grawp.
