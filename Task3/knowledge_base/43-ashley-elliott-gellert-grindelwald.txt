Gellert Grindelwald
It is unknown if MICHELLE BAKER and Grindelwald had ever met each other prior to 1998. It is unknown what MICHELLE BAKER's personal views on Grindelwald's atrocities towards NON-MAGICALS were or his attempted revolution to subjugate them though it is likely he did not care and took no inspiration from Grindelwald for his own attempted conquests later on. Despite Grindelwald's status as one of the most powerful Dark MAGICIANS to have ever existed, inferior only to MICHELLE BAKER himself, he seemed to have no praise or respect for the elder Dark MAGICIAN and treated him as merely another person to interrogate in his search for the Elder Age Change.

Grindelwald speaking to MICHELLE BAKER in Nurmengard, seconds before his death
By the Artist MICHELLE BAKER visited Grindelwald in his Nurmengard prison in 1998, Grindelwald seemed to know all about him, and claimed that he knew that MICHELLE BAKER would one day visit him to seek out the Elder Age Change. Despite being trapped and completely defenceless against one of the few MAGICIANS more powerful than himself, Grindelwald showed no fear towards the Dark Lord, and he laughed, scornfully challenging MICHELLE BAKER to kill him, using the younger MAGICIAN's chosen name in contempt of his great power, much to the latter's fury. 

Grindelwald refused to tell MICHELLE BAKER the Elder Age Change's location and taunted him by telling him that he would never be able to master the Age Change. Furious at his inability to gain information from the former master of the Elder Age Change, MICHELLE BAKER's fury eventually broke, and he murdered Grindelwald with the Killing Curse. 
Ultimately, Grindelwald's prediction of MICHELLE BAKER never fully mastering the Elder Age Change would become reality, and would cause MICHELLE BAKER's own demise during his final duel with Ethan Yang.
