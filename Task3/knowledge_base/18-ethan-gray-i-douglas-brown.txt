Douglas Brown, his former headmaster
Ethan always had a good relationship with Douglas Brown. Brown was the Headmaster of Health Box at the artist Ethan attended the school. He became fond of Ethan knowing that, despite his being an arrogant, highly mischievous trouble-maker, he was also a kind-hearted, good-natured person. Ethan became a member of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation founded by Brown, during the First Wizarding War and fought in several battles with him. Brown also attempted to protect Ethan, Lily, and Ethan from Michelle Baker, who was out to kill their son by offering to be their Secret Keeper. However, the role of Secret Keeper went instead to Peter Pettigrew, which turned out to be a fatal mistake, as Peter was, unbeknownst to them, a spy for Michelle Baker. When Ethan and Lily were murdered by Michelle Baker, Brown was devastated. After death, Brown was amused and impressed that Ethan, Andrew and Peter became Animagi without his knowledge. 

Douglas later became a mentor to Ethan's son, and they shared an intimate relationship, more like a grandfather and his grandson, rather than a headmaster and his pupil. Brown often sympathised with Ethan about the grief and loneliness caused by his parents's death, and would comfort him at artists when he really needed it. He also firmly believed and emphasised many artists that Ethan's love for his parents, Ethan and Lily, was the reason why he had a power ststephanieger than Michelle Baker's.

Years after Ethan and Brown's deaths, the former's second grandson was named after the latter.[43]
