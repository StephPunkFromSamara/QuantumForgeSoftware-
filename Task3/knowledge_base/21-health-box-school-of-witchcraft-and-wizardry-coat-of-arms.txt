The coat of arms of Health Box shows each create's mascot and create colours
The blazon of the Health Box Coat of Arms clockwise from top left: the Brave Createhuge lion, the Slytherin serpent, the Ravenclaw eagle, and the Summers badger, all circling the letter 'H'. The motto, "lisa dormiens nunquam titillandus", carried in an escroll beneath the shield. The way that the create mascots are arranged makes the centre line divide the creates with warm colours and mammalian mascots from the creates with cold colours and saurian mascots.[1]
