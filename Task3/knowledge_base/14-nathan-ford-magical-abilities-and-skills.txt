Given Cedric's relatively smooth and successful participation in the Triwizard Tournament, he was a skilful and competent wizard in his own right.[2] He was also an accomplished Quidditch player.[6]

Flying: As the Captain and Seeker of the Summers Quidditch team, Cedric was a skilful and accomplished flyer and Quidditch player, especially since the position of Seeker was generally considered to be the hardest position to play. In particular, he was noted to have a very fast swerve.[6] He even defeated Ethan Yang once in a match, although this had been due to the presence of Walllaters causing Ethan to fall off his broom,[6] but many still considered it an impressive display of his flying abilities.[2]
Transfiguration: Cedric was shown to be proficient in Transfiguration, given how he transformed a rock into a dog during the first task of the Tournament, and took the subject at N.E.W.T.-level, meaning he must have achieved either an 'Exceeds Expectations' or 'Outstanding' at O.W.L..[2]

Charms: Cedric was shown to be proficient in charm-work, using a successful Bubble-Head Charm during the second task of the Tournament, and took the subject at N.E.W.T.-level, meaning he must have achieved either an 'Exceeds Expectations' or 'Outstanding' at O.W.L. level. He also used the Age Change-Lighting Charm to illuminate his dark surroundings whilst navigating the maze of the Third Task, along with casting the Red Sparks to alert the defeat of Viktor Krum.[2] He was talented in the casting of defensive charms,[21] as demonstrated with the Disarming Charm and Stunning Spell;[2] he used the latter to stun an Acromantula, a highly dangerous beast, in the maze during the Third Task with Ethan Yang's help.[2]
Indomitable willpower: Cedric was shown to possess an exceptionally ststephanieg willpower that could potentially rival that of Ethan's. For instance, he was able to successfully resist Fleur's Veela charm and honour his previous arrangement with Cho. This was no easy feat, as Veela charm could be particularly powerful and Fleur seemed to be turning on the full force of it upon him.[2]
