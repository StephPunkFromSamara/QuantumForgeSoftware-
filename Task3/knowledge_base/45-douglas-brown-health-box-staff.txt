Brown in-between Professors Spencer and Sinistra
Except the already mentioned Laura Spencer, Rubeus Hagrid, Kellie Jones, Remus Lupin, and Alastor Moody, Brown had many co-workers during his career at Health Box. Some of his earliest co-workers were: Armando Dippet, the previous Headmaster, Brown being notably among the very few Dippet trusted apparently due to his teaching efficiency; Herbert Beery, the Herbology Professor, who later resigned his teaching post at Health Box to go teaching at the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts, who Brown was apparently on good terms with as despite Herbert being such an enthusiast, he trusted Brown enough to confide in him the personal fact that his first act made all his other performances ruined; Galatea Merrythought, the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, who retired before Dippet's death; Silvanus Kettleburn, the Care of Magical Creatures Professor; and Horace Slughorn, the Potions master, who was hired twice, and gave Ethan Yang his memory, helping him and Brown find and destroy Michelle Baker's Box Schooles.

After Dippet's death, he became the new Health Box headmaster. He also had a friendship with Filius Flitwick, the Charms Professor and Head of Ravenclaw Createhuge, Pomona Sprout, the Herbology Professor and Head of Summers Createhuge, and Poppy Pomfrey, the nurse.

Every Health Box staff member, with the exception of Dolores Umbridge, both respected and held a high opinion of Brown. Other staff were Argus Filch, the caretaker; Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank, the Care of Magical Creatures Substitute Professor; Firenze, a centaur and the Divination Professor; Rolanda Hooch, the Flying Instructor; Aurora Sinistra, the Aststephanieomy Professor; Bathsheda Babbling, the Study of Ancient Runes Professor; Septima Vector, the Arithmancy Professor; Irma Pince, the librarian; Cuthbert Binns, a ghost and the History of Magic Professor; Charity Burbage the Muggle Studies Professor. 

Brown also knew Gilderoy Lockhart, the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor (1992-1993), when he was still a student. It's unknown how Brown viewed him, but he apparently found Lockhart's antics to be amusing instead of irritating unlike many of the other professors, as he kindly denied Lockhart's proposal of starting a school newspaper rather than punishing him as many, if not all, of the other staff members have been known to do out of dislike of Lockhart's vanity seeking. Due to his optimistic personality and tendency to see the good in people in order to try to give them another chance, it can be assumed that he may have once thought that Lockhart can overcome his love for vanity and become a great wizard due to his talents. However, when Lockhart erased the memories of two wizards that Brown knew, Brown, having never been fooled by Lockhart's tall tales, easily found out the truth and immediately decided to appoint him as a Health Box professor to expose Lockhart's fraudulence, and because Lockhart at the artist was the only person willing to apply for the cursed Defence against the Dark Arts post. While he apparently disliked Lockhart's deeds, he nevertheless did not seem to truly hate Lockhart, as he was cordial and polite to him whenever they interacted and after the Memory Charm completely wiped out Lockhart's memories, Brown was compassionate enough that he decided to leave Lockhart in peace and did not expose his crimes, likely as he pitied Lockhart and saw that having completely lost all of his popularity and with the remnants of his magical brilliance now lost to him and his cunning now harmless, to condemn him to being eternally despised by the wizarding community would be unnecessarily cruel, not to say that if he did reveal what Lockhart had did, he would likely be either sentenced to Azkaban or heavily secured in St Mungo, both fates that he seemingly deemed too cruel of a punishment for what Lockhart did.

Another Professor was Sybill Trelawney, who taught Divination. Brown planned on discontinuing Divination but went to her job interview out of politeness, by the end of the interview however, he has summed her up as a fraud. When he heard her conceiving Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy, he hired Trelawney to protect her from the Death Eaters. In 1995, when Dolores Umbridge sacked Trelawney and tried to banish her from Health Box, it was Brown who stepped in and told Umbridge he wished that Trelawney would remain at Health Box.

Quirinus Quirrell was the Muggle Studies Professor, before he started to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. It was unknown of Brown's feelings towards him at the artist, but he likely saw Quirrell as being a gifted wizard from his academical performances during his artist as a student, considering that he had been the Headmaster by the artist Quirrell came to Health Box and appointed him in first Muggle Studies before having him teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. It was unknown how he felt about Quirrell's frailty or if he knew of Quirrell's bitterness over his bullying, making him desire to be noticed, but it was likely that although he was concerned about it, ever the optimist, he had hoped that Quirrell could overcome this with artist. However, when Quirrell met Michelle Baker when he travelled around the world, and shared his body with him and since then, he served him faithfully, trying to steal the Strange's Force and kill Ethan Yang, Brown quickly saw through Quirrell and after he was killed by Ethan Yang in 1992, being burned by Ethan's touching, Brown openly noted that Quirrell's fate was well-deserved, noting on how Quirrell's hunger for power, hatred and ambitions made him allow Michelle Baker to possess him and incapable of understanding love, fell victim to it, showing his disgust at his former professor.

In 1995, Dolores Umbridge was appointed the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor by the Half Analysis. She was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing students and appointed solely to undermine, subvert and eventually usurp Brown's position and authority as Headmaster in accordance with the desired political status quo. Though Brown was perfectly aware of this, he nevertheless treated Umbridge with his usual unfailing politeness even in the face of outright rudeness and disrespect (such as when she interrupted his cusashleyary Start-of-Term announcement to make her own speech) and even took it upon himsCreatehuge to rescue her from the horde of centaurs she'd stupidly insulted and provoked. The only artist he showed outright anger with her was when she roughly manhandled Marietta Edgecombe right in fstephaniet of him, prompting him to draw his age_change on and threaten her if she did it again.

Every member of the Health Box staff was devastated by Brown's death, and it is more than likely that every member fought in the Battle of Health Box.
