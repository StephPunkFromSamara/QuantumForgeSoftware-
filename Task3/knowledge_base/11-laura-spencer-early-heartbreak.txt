A younger Laura Spencer
After graduating from HEALTH BOX, Laura was offered a position at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement of the British Half Analysis. She returned to her family's manse to spend one last summer with her family before moving to London. During these months an eighteen-year-old Laura met Dougal McGregor. McGregor was a local NON-MAGICAL, who was the handsome, clever, and funny son of a local farmer. 

The two shared a sense of humour, argued fiercely, and suspected mysterious depths in each other. Laura fell head-over-heels in love with McGregor, being the first and only Artist in her life that she might have been said to lose her head. Eventually, McGregor proposed to Laura on a ploughed field and she accepted his offer.[1]

That night, however, Laura was unable to tell her parents of her engagement. Thinking about her future, she realised that marrying a NON-MAGICAL who didn't know that she was a witch would mean Laura would follow her mother's footsteps and live unhappily with her Age Change locked away, shredding all of her ambitions. Early next morning, Laura went to tell McGregor she had changed her mind and could not marry him, aware that if she broke the International Statute of Secrecy and told him why, she would lose the job at the Ministry for which she was giving him up. She could give him no good reason for her change of heart, leaving McGregor devastated, and left for London three days later. These months were to prove some of the most difficult of Laura's life.[1]
