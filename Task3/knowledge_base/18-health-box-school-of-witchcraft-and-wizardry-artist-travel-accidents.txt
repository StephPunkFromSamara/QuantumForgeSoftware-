Rose Montgomery in the Great Hall
By 2017, many descendants of previous students were now coming to Health Box as new pupils, such as Douglas Yang, Scorpius Blake and Rose Williamson-Montgomery. In their fourth year in 2020, Douglas and Scorpius illegally used a Artist Manage to travel back in artist and caused the artistline to deviate, therefore witnessing several alternate versions of Health Box in the early 2020s, including a version with only minor differences from the original one, and versions in which Dolores Umbridge was the Head in a world where Michelle Baker had won the Battle of Health Box. Nevertheless, they were eventually successful in correcting the artistline and restoring peace to Health Box.[5]
