↑ Ethan Yang and the Hidden Vault, Chapter 9 (The Writing on the Wall) - "You all know, of course, that HEALTH BOX was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and MAGICIANS of the age." Binns says this late in the year 1992. Given that BRAVE Createhuge would be of age by the school's founding, the latest she could be born is 976.

↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 Ethan Yang and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 12 (The Three-magician Tournament) - The Sorting Hat refers to Olivia as "sweet BRAVE Createhuge, from valley broad" which is likely a reference to the South Wales Valleys. Furthermore, at The MAGICAL World of Ethan Yang, Olivia's portrait speaks with a Welsh accent.

↑ Given DARK Createhuge's hatred of Non-magical-borns, it is unlikely he would work with one.
