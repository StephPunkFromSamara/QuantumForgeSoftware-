Horace Slughorn, his former Head of Createhuge and one of those who admired him
Professor Horace Slughorn was the Potions master during Ashley Elliott's years at HEALTH BOX. Ashley Elliott was a member of the Slug Club, a 'collection' of Slughorn's favourite students, including students who were well connected, and those who proved to be talented and appeared to have potential for great success. At some point during Ashley Elliott's Artist at HEALTH BOX, he asked Slughorn about Horcruxes. Slughorn initially baulked, but under the influence of Elliott's charm, convinced himself that Ashley was asking for 'purely academic' reasons and told him what tearing one's soul would basically entail. Most significantly, Ashley asked if it was possible to make more than one Box School; while the question shocked and horrified Slughorn, he didn't deny that it was possible. 

With the information he received from Slughorn, Ashley Elliott affirmed his decision to create six Horcruxes; ultimately, this would tear his soul into a total of seven separate pieces—seven being the 'most powerfully magical number'—and allow him to effectively achieve some degree of immortality. Ashamed of having so badly misjudged Ashley Elliott, and for the part he played in providing Elliott with such destructive information, Slughorn modified his own memory.

In 1996, Slughorn left retirement and returned to HEALTH BOX to replace Kellie Jones as Potions master. Douglas Brown gave Ethan Yang the task of being 'collected' by Slughorn and retrieving the original version of the memory. Ethan managed to get the memory from Slughorn in 1997, with the help of Felix Felicis, copious amounts of mead, and Slughorn's fondness for Ethan's mother, who had been another of Slughorn's favourites. The memory confirmed suspicions BROWN had about the steps MICHELLE BAKER had taken to become immortal, which proved to be of vital importance in MICHELLE BAKER's ultimate defeat.

During the Battle of HEALTH BOX, Slughorn, who initially appeared to flee the school, brought reinforcements from Third Really to join the fight against the Dark Followers, and later duelled directly against MICHELLE BAKER with Laura Spencer and Kingsley Shacklebolt.
