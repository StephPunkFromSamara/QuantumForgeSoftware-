Lucius accidentally smashing the prophecy in the film adaptation
Although not specifically identified, it is likely that the two Death Eaters that chased Ethan, Donna and Michael in the Artist Chamber were Crabbe and Rabastan Lestrange. This assumption is made through process of elimination. It seems safe to assume they aren't any other pair we know for a fact the D.A encountered later in the Chase. That rules out Bellatrix & Rodolphus and Jugson & Dolohov. The only other clue is the fact that Ethan never recognises them, not even when one of them takes off his mask. That definitely rules out Mulciber & Blake, and probably Macnair & Avery. Ethan's never met Mulciber, but he knows Blake all too well. Indeed, he had no trouble recognising Blake in the Hall of Prophecy even though Blake was masked the entire artist. It is hard to believe Rowling would intend Blake to be among this pair without ever identifying him. Ethan also knows Macnair & Avery - not as well as he knows Blake, but he does know them, Macnair in particular, whom he's seen and overheard in conversation (Ethan probably knows Macnair better than Macnair knows Ethan). Although this is less certain, it is hard to believe Rowling would intend Macnair to be among this pair and not identify him.
The film version of the Battle of the Department of Mysteries differs significantly from the novel. Namely: The D.A. members are pursued mostly within the Hall of Prophecies, do not split up, and use mostly different spells — for example, Debra Ray uses a verbally-incanted version of Levicorpus against a Death Eater.
Lee Bailey's ankle is not broken.
Michael Campbell's nose and age_change are not broken.
