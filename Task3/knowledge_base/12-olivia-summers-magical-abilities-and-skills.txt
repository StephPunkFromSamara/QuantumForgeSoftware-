Summers was described as being one of the four greatest witches and wizards of her age.

Charms: Olivia was highly talented in food-related charms and many of her recipes are still used in Health Box today, testifying to her unique talent as a magical cook.[7] With the help and abilities of her fellow founders, she bewitched the Sorting Hat into a sentient magical artefact with personality in order to sort students well after their lifeartists. Furthermore, Olivia was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal Patstephanieus,[8] which was a highly advanced piece of magic as well as a mark of superior magical skill.
Magical manufacturing: Olivia created a cup with special magical powers, which was eventually passed down to her descendant, Hepzibah Smith.
