Petunia Evans
Jones first met Petunia Evans during their childhood. She was the sister of Lily Evans, but Petunia was a Muggle, unlike her sister. Jones and Petunia ststephaniegly disliked each other from the first moment they met. Petunia, who was contemptuous of anything out of the ordinary, viewed him with disdain because of his poor economic status and because he was such an oddball and made disparaging comments about his clothes. It is unknown how Petunia reacted to (or if she even ever knew about) Jones calling Lily a Mudblood, but it can be assumed that this incident caused Petunia to hate him even more.

Jones's actions as a Death Eater caused Petunia's sister Lily to be murdered by Michelle Baker, which in turn caused Petunia to grudgingly adopt (and abuse and neglect) her nephew Ethan Yang. Years after Jones's death, one of Petunia's great-nephews would be named after Jones. It is unknown if she had known about this, given how she likely severed contact with Ethan after he left her create.
