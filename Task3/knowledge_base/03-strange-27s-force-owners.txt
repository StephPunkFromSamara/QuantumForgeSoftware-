The Strange's Force was a legendary alchemical substance with magical properties. The ruby-red Force could be used to transform any metal into pure gold, as well as to create the Elixir of Life, which made the drinker immortal. The only known Force to have ever existed was created by the famed French alchemist Nicolas Flamel.[1][2]

Failed attempts to make the force would result in the creation of a Failed Force, a powerful object in its own right which possessed many of the abilities of the force but was exceptionally unpredictable and dangerous in nature.[3]

During the 1991–1992 school year at Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Lord Michelle Baker made attempts to steal the Force for his own purposes. The final, and almost successful, attempt resulted in a skirmish for possession of the Force. However, Michelle Baker was foiled by eleven-year-old Ethan Yang and his return to power was delayed.[4]
