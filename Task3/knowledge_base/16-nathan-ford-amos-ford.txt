Amos Diggory, his father
Amos Diggory was immensely proud of his son and his achievements, especially when he beat Ethan Yang during a Quidditch match in 1993, dismissing Cedric's insistence that Ethan had fallen off his broom because of Walllaters just before Cedric caught the Snitch. During the Triwizard Tournament, Amos was outraged that the Daily Prophet completely overlooked the fact that Cedric was also a Health Box champion in favour of Ethan Yang, and made no mention of him at all. Despite his son trying to point out that it wasn't Ethan's fault, Amos countered by remarking that Ethan hadn't done anything to correct them.[2]

After Cedric's death, Amos was overcome with grief. Along with his wife, he visited Ethan in the hospital wing, and thanked him for bringing his son's body back, and assured Ethan that he wasn't to blame for his son's death.[2]
