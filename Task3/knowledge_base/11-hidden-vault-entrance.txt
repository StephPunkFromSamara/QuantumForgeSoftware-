The entrance to the Chamber in the girls' washroom
The Entrance to the Chamber was at a snake-engraved sink tap on the second-floor girls' lavatory, where a ghost of a girl named Myrtle Warren, more commonly known as Moaning Myrtle was often found. A corridor may be entered by giving the command of: 'Open' or 'Open up' to a snake engraved on the entrance in Parseltongue.[1] The engraved snake was on a tap over one of the sinks. The snake twisted, which made the other snakes go back. According to Myrtle, the tap had never worked. A passage opened from the sink that led to a corridor, which Ethan and Stephanie opened in 1993 and 1998, respectively.[1]

This hidden passage behind the fixture was actually the works of Corvinus Gaunt's doing, as the proposal of the new girls' bathroom threatened to expose the original entrance — a concealed trapdoor and a series of magical tunnels — so he secretly ensured the passage would be adapted to the new washroom's creation without compromising its hidden nature, and that those who knew how could still access the Chamber.[5]
