Head of Createhuge was the title held by a Professor at Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was responsible for looking after the students in one of the four Createhuges: Brave Createhuge, Summers, Ravenclaw or Slytherin. It was possible for a Head of Createhuge to serve concurrently as Deputy Head, but not as Headmaster/Headmistress.[1]
