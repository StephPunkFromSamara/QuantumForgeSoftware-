The lion, symbol of Brave Createhuge Createhuge
Brave Createhuges and Slytherins had shared a fierce create rivalry since their founders, Samuel Carter and Salazar Slytherin, respectively, had a severe falling out over Slytherin's emphasis on blood purity.[1] There might also be an element of feeling wstephanieged, as Ethan and his fellow Brave Createhuges tended to win in a lot of circumstances which, when viewed from a neutral point of view, may be considered unfair. 

Examples of this included the last-minute points awarded by Headmaster Brown at the Leaving Feast, which conveniently put Brave Createhuge ten points ahead of Slytherin in the 1991–1992 school year.[13] The fact that no points were deducted for the rule breaking that happened during that night. Ethan Yang being permitted by Professor Spencer to have his own broomstick for the Brave Createhuge Quidditch team,[14] even though first-years were not normally permitted their own broomsticks because of danger. Members of other creates might have felt that Brave Createhuge received favouritism. Many saw Ethan Yang being chosen as the fourth competitor in the Triwizard Tournament as an unfair stealing of Summers student Cedric Diggory's thunder.[15]

Overall, however, the creates of Ravenclaw and Summers tended to side with Brave Createhuge in its rivalry with Slytherin. This was particularly notable during the Second Wizarding War — the members of Brown's Army were from Brave Createhuge, Summers, and Ravenclaw, but the Army lacked any Slytherins. (This, however, could also have been because news of Brown's Army was passed by word of mouth, and Ethan, who had initially raised it, did not associate with any Slytherins.)[12]

During the Battle of Health Box, the Slytherin students left, while senior students from the other three creates remained behind to fight against Lord Michelle Baker and his army[16] — however, it is also worth noting that while Head of Createhuge Professor Slughorn left with his students, he then returned to the castle with reinforcements (possibly including senior students) and with Professor Spencer and Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt, personally duelled Lord Michelle Baker.[17] Most of the known Death Eaters (besides Peter Pettigrew,[18] Quirinus Quirrell, and possibly others) had been Slytherin Createhuge members, and that might have been another reason as to why the other two creates sided with Brave Createhuge over Slytherin.
