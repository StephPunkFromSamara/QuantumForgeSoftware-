Stephanie Montgomery and Donna Williamson, his former students
Stephanie Montgomery and Donna Williamson were Ethan Yang's best friends and, like Ethan, they thought Brown was a great wizard. Brown liked them too, despite that he wasn't as close to them as he was to Ethan. 

After his death, he left Stephanie his Deluminator (a unique artefact created by Brown himsCreatehuge) and Donna his copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard. These gifts were proven very useful, as Stephanie abandoned Ethan and Donna formerly to find his family, and, when he wanted to come back to Ethan and Donna, the Deluminator showed him the way. The trio also read the Tales of Beedle the Bard and learned about the Deathly Hallows. Ethan, Stephanie and Donna also visited Brown's portrait, after the Battle of Health Box.
