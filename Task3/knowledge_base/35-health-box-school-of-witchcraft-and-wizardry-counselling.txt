The posting for careers advice
Health Box students received career advice from their Heads of Createhuge in their O.W.L. year, some weeks prior to the examinations, to help establish what subjects the students needed to concentrate on to achieve the required O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. scores for their chosen occupations.[73]

In fifth year, the students would get career advice, which would help students choose their N.E.W.T. subjects. Bill Montgomery told his younger brother Stephanie about it. Before their examination (during the Easter break) the students would receive a batch of leaflets, advertising different jobs available to Health Box students and the N.E.W.T.s required for them. Examples were: Healing, Muggle relations, Wizard banking, Training Security trolls, and working at the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.[73]

During the first week of summer term, the students discussed their future careers with the Head of Createhuges during a careers appointment. Ethan Yang discussed his wish to become an Auror with Spencer, who described it as a difficult career path to take. The requirements were high: five N.E.W.T.s. and passing of character and aptitude tests. Auror training then took another three years of study.[73]

Percy Montgomery was still reading about his future career possibilities after his careers advice. In Floor Could, he read about the later careers of Health Box prefects, just before he started his sixth year.[55]

Ethan first thought of his career after Health Box when he discussed it with Bartemius Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody) in his fourth year. Crouch suggested that he (and Donna Williamson) would be suitable to become Aurors.[25]

Oddly enough, the students of Health Box did not appear to receive similar counselling at the end of their second year, when they chose the elective subjects that could determine their future careers.
