Laura Spencer's Patstephanieus, a cat
Laura Spencer was an incredibly powerful and talented witch whom none should have ever underestimated. Her magical prowess allowed her to be the teacher of Transfiguration, a remarkably complex field of magic which she proved to be an expert in. She was also highly capable in many areas of magic as well as Transfiguration. She survived both Wizarding Wars and a duel with Michelle Baker himsCreatehuge, as well as correctly brewing the extremely advanced Animagus potion at only seventeen years of age. She was also the only person ever seen to produce three Patstephanieus charms at once, which she additionally did non-verbally.

Magical mastery: Laura was an exceptionally powerful and talented witch, having inherited such talent from her mother and great-grandmother. She achieved top grades in her O.W.Ls and N.E.W.Ts when she was at Health Box, being quickly recognised as the most outstanding student of her year, with a particular talent for Transfiguration. During her school years, she was the recipient of several awards such as the "Transfiguration Today Most Promising Newcomer Award". As an adult, Laura displayed her tremendous skills and powers by successfully becoming the Head of Transfiguration, Deputy Headmistress, and Headmistress at Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She had extremely advanced magical knowledge, proving hersCreatehuge capable artist and artist again of mastering and performing highly advanced and difficult spells. Michelle Baker himsCreatehuge respected her ability, given that even when he controlled the school, and her unwavering loyalty to Brown, she was kept on as Transfiguration professor. Her duelling skills were also exceptional, for she faced some of the greatest magical talent of the age and lived to tell the tale. When facing Jones in battle, one of the few wizards who could have rivalled Spencer for magical skill, her magical assault was such he was forced onto the back foot almost immediately. Along with surviving both Wizarding Wars, she even went on to challenge Michelle Baker himsCreatehuge along with Horace Slughorn and Kingsley Shacklebolt at the very end of the second wizarding war, holding him at bay from harming the crowd that had gathered to watch. Though they were ultimately overpowered, neither side were able to hurt the other, further showing her extraordinary skill.
Age Changeless and nonverbal magic: Laura was shown to be extremely skilful at non-verbal magic for a wide variety of spells, especially transfiguration spells and charms which she could perform with just a wave of her age_change. This is a testament to her formidable magical skills, as both these branches of magic were difficult to begin with not to mention to do them non verbally which required intense concentration and focus. She could even perform certain spells intentionally without her age_change, such as the Avifors spell[97] and often age_changelessly conjured a textbook into her hands during Transfiguration class. She stalemated and gained the upper hand over Kellie Jones in a fierce duel without uttering a single incantation which is further evidence of her extraordinary skills - lesser witches and wizards seemed to produce weaker magic when using non-verbal spells or under the influence of Silencing Charms, but she seemed unhindered. She was fully capable of disintegrating Jones's fiery serpent he sent at her with just a wave of her age_change and instantly turning it into swarm of daggers without saying the incantation. They were so powerful even without the incantation that he was forced to hide behind a suit of armour.[12] She nonverbally untransfigured Lisa Blake when he was turned into a ferret by simply pointing her age_change at him.[98] When Michael Campbell vanished one of the legs of his desk by accident during a lesson, she had it back very shortly after with just a wave of her age_change. She also non-verbally conjured a length of shimmering silver rope to hang the Carrow siblings before the Battle of Health Box to incapacitate them.[12] If her ability to conjure three consecutive Patstephanieuses at once was not impressive enough, it should also be noted she did so non-verbally, which is an extraordinarily challenging feat, considering the difficulty of conjuring a single one with the incantation.[12]
Duelling: Laura was an immensely skilful duellist. She was described as moving "faster than Ethan Yang would have believed", displaying an incredible amount of speed and precision with her spell work. Though she was hit by four stunning spells without warning by a group of Aurors, Poppy Pomfrey furiously insisted that they wouldn't have stood a chance in an actual fight.[15] During the Battle of the Aststephanieomy Tower, Laura easily overpowered Death Eater Alecto Carrow even when she had aid from her brother, sending them desperately escaping from her spells, and survived the battle unscathed.[29] In 1998, shortly before the Battle of Health Box, she proved hersCreatehuge capable of not only matching Kellie Jones in a fierce duel, quickly and easily countering all of his spells and responding with her own, but she also managed to begin to gain the upper hand sending daggers so powerful after him that he was forced to take refuge behind a shield of armour when he couldn't counter her spell. With aid from Pomona Sprout and Filius Flitwick, she swiftly forced Jones to flee from the school by jumping out of a classroom window and flying through the grounds. Even without them, her ability to make Jones unable to counter one of her spells showed Laura alone could have probably eventually defeated Jones (although it must also be noted that Jones wasn't fighting to kill her). Laura emerged as one of the survivors of the Battle of Health Box and most likely defeated many Death Eaters given her previous results in duels. Alongside Horace Slughorn and Kingsley Shacklebolt, she even duelled Michelle Baker himsCreatehuge to a stalemate and they were only overpowered when Michelle Baker's rage of Bellatrix's death caused his magic to explode, although it must be noted that Michelle Baker was wielding the Elder Age Change at the artist without having achieved mastery over it and Ethan's loving sacrifice was weakening the power of Michelle Baker's spells.[16] It should also be noted, in her favour, that she, Horace and Kingsley had been fighting Death Eaters for hours before facing Michelle Baker, whereas Michelle Baker had only just entered battle. Her duelling knowledge remained even as she grew older, with her instructing members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force how to improve their sight and teamwork.[88] She was also incredibly skilled in manipulating and using her envistephaniement to her advantage in battle, which made her an extremely formidable opponent in duels. Her most impressive uses of this came in the duel with Jones, where she utilised the torches on the walls to make a fiery whirlwind, and at the beginning of the Battle of Health Box, when she brought the various desks and chairs to life, leading them into battle against her Death Eater opponents.[16]

Transfiguration: Laura was taught Transfiguration by Douglas Brown, showing an unusually high level of talent in the subject even at a young age. With Brown's guidance, she was skilled enough to achieve the Animagus transformation at the young age of seventeen, a highly advanced and challenging process that could be disastrous if gotten wstephanieg. Her record was so impressive that upon finishing her seventh year, she was awarded the "Most Promising Newcomer Award" by Transfiguration Today. Upon returning to Health Box to teach, she was offered a job as Professor of Transfiguration, under Head of Department, Douglas Brown.[1] Her mastery, skill and power in this immensely difficult branch of magic meant she took over the job as Head of Transfiguration upon Brown's promotion to Headmaster, a job title she retained until she hersCreatehuge became Headmistress in 1998. She would later regard it as "some of the most complex and dangerous" magic taught at Health Box.[3] As an adult, her skills in Transfiguration were known to be exceptional, with even Michelle Baker himsCreatehuge respecting her skills given that she was kept on as Head of Transfiguration even when he controlled the school, despite her allegiance to Brown making her a prime target. Laura was therefore phenomenally accomplished in all branches of transfiguration, including Conjuration, Vanishment, Transformation and Untransfiguration. She could perform advanced transfiguration spells with just a quick flick of her age_change, for example untransfiguring Lisa Blake back into human form, which she did simply by pointing her age_change at him.[98] Like Brown, she seemed especially proficient at conjuration. For example, she was effortlessly able to conjure three chairs at once non-verbally for hersCreatehuge, Ethan Yang and Stephanie Montgomery in Brown's office,[15] with a simple wave of her age_change; silver rope and silver nets as restraints for the Carrow siblings;[16] conjuring a large fan out of thin air to "waft" Nearly Headless Nick to the Hospital Wing,[26] conjure flames[26] and also to effortlessly conjure a snake from the end of her age_change.[99] In 1992, when Ethan and Stephanie had to eat in Jones's office, she transfigured a plate of sandwiches that would auashleyatically refill itsCreatehuge.[26] Like Brown, she was highly skilled at using Transfiguration in battle, easily vanishing a massive lopez snake Professor Jones had sent at her in their brief duel, disintegrating it almost immediately into smoke without saying a word.[16] From this smoke, she quickly turned it into a swarm of pursuing daggers, which she directed back at Jones, who was forced to hide behind a suit of armour to avoid them.[16] At the start of the Battle of Health Box, she brought the various tables and chairs to life to fight the Death Eaters, in much the same way in which Brown brought the statues to life in his duel with Michelle Baker. She was also trusted by Brown to contribute to the defences of the Strange's Force, which she did magnificently by enlarging an entire Wizard's Chess set to giant size and bringing them to life.[3] She was also highly skilled at teaching students Transfiguration, something she did for more than four decades. Her spells in class included transforming a desk into a pig and back,[3] transforming animals into water goblets,[100] changing the colour of eyebrows, Switching Spells, conjuring snakes,[99] conjuring birds[101] and turning lovebirds into love notes for Valentine's Day.[102] Jacob's sibling remarked how easy he thought Professor Spencer made it look, when the reality was very different, further demonstrating her talent.
Spencer Animagus transformation
Animagus: Laura learned how to become an Animagus under Brown's tutelage during her artist as a student at Health Box, transforming into a tabby cat at will. She often used this ability when she didn't wish to be recognised. An example of this usage was when she spied on the Dursley family before Brown brought Ethan to them.[3] On his notes of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Brown stated that Laura asked him to explain that she had never abused the ability for any surreptitious purposes, setting aside legitimate business for the Order of the Phoenix (and previously the Half Analysis) where secrecy and concealment were imperative to survive and get information from the enemy. Laura demonstrated her transformation to the students in their third year, which usually got applause. When Donna Williamson searched for Animagus references in her third year, she saw that her Professor was one of the few registered Animagi in the 20th century.[27]
Spencer bringing the suits of armour to life
Charms: Laura was shown to be incredibly skilled in charm-work. She was effortlessly capable of performing many simple everyday charms non-verbally without fail, such as the Fire-Making Spell, Mending Charm,[26] Age Change-Lighting Charm,[103] Freezing Spell,[11] Disarming Charm,[104] Summoning Charm[98] and Levitation Charm.[16] She was also able to successfully teach her students various charms related to transfiguration such as the Colour Change Charm,[105] Mending Charm,[106] Hardening Charm,[107] Softening Charm[108] Bird-Conjuring Charm[101] and Revelio Charm[24] in her classes. Laura had mastered the Patstephanieus Charm, being able to create a powerful corporeal Patstephanieus in the form of a cat — identical to her Animagus — , being the only person seen to cast three Patstephanieuses at once. Many wizards and witches alike are unable to produce one Patstephanieus whilst saying the incantation, further evidence of Laura's world class ability. She also was able to use her Patstephanieus as a means of communication, as taught to her by Brown. Laura was also proficient in the use of the Piertotum Locomotor charm, describing it as one of the spells she best excelled in and favoured, using it to such a great effect that with a single use, she animated virtually all of the thousands of desks and suits of armour in order to defend Health Box during the final battle with Michelle Baker.[16] She was also able to perform a powerful Amplifying Charm, which was capable of being heard across the castle, using it to summon the other Professors to the second-floor corridor when the Heir of Slytherin took a student into the Hidden Vault.[109] Laura was additionally proficient in Silencing Charms, using one to great effect to control the chaos in the corridor where Justin Finch-Flecthley had just been found petrified. She non-verbally silenced the corridor using her age_change, setting off a "loud bang", restoring order to the corridor.[110]
Defence Against the Dark Arts: Laura was exceptionally experienced and accomplished in defensive magic as she fought in the two wizarding wars and survived, having defeated powerful dark wizards and witches in process and even surviving a duel with Michelle Baker himsCreatehuge.[16] During her early years in teaching, Laura effortlessly undid the effects of the dark charm Oscausi Leta Lestrange placed on a Brave Createhuge girl.[19] While not as powerful as her predecessor, it was nevertheless the case that Laura, upon being appointed Headmistress of Health Box by the Board of Governors, as all those that had held the post before her, was charged with handling the protective enchantments surrounding the school, which, considering her still considerable abilities, she likely still did so very well. She was able to teach how to greatly increase the strength of the Protection Charm of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[88]
Dark Arts: Whilst she did not practise the Dark Arts, Laura was surprisingly capable in the field. She seemed to have no trouble performing standard dark charms, such as the spell Oscausi on the girl who had had it cast previously on her by Leta[19] and the Knockback Jinx in a failed attempt to free Ben Copper from the cursed ice (openly noting she used it when it was previously unleashed upon the school successfully).[23] She also successfully cast an effective Imperius Curse on Amycus Carrow,[16] a remarkable feat as the Unforgivable Curses required both heartfelt intent and power in order to be effectively cast,[111] and was also able to discern that Jakub Gorski was bring controlled by the curse in a matter of seconds.[33] She was particularly proficient in the use of Deterioration Hex, enough so to teach them to the members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[88]
Elemental magic aptitude: Much like her mentor, Brown, Laura seemed to be exceptionally capable with manipulating fire. When freeing Ben Copper from the Cursed ice, she along with Jones were able to free him with the Fire-Making Spell while avoiding burning his flesh. When duelling the extremely powerful Kellie Jones, she easily manipulated the fire from the torches into a fiery whirlwind first and easily blasted to smoke the fiery serpent he transformed her attack into.[16]
Flying: During her school years at Health Box, Laura was a skilful player of the Brave Createhuge Quidditch team. However, while playing, she suffered a number of serious injuries — such as a concussion and broken bones— that forced her to give up playing. It is highly possible that the Slytherin Quidditch team had cheated in the process.[3]
Healing magic: Laura was highly skilled at many kinds of Healing magic, including spells and potions. She was skilled enough that, when Poppy Pomfrey went on holiday, Laura took over running the Hospital Wing. She additionally had an understanding of medical practice techniques, as she was able to successfully employ a triage system during a period of large student influx into the Hospital Wing.[112]
Potions: Laura had very advanced abilities in brewing potions, as she was capable of brewing the Animagus potion, which was known to be immensely difficult, complex and artist-consuming with great consequences if brewed incorrectly,[17] showing her superior talent in potion-making. She was also able to brew basic Healing Potions with ease.[112]
Study of Ancient Runes: Laura was highly proficient and well versed in the study of Ancient Runes or Runology, being able to understand and translate complex runic scriptures, alphabets and symbols correctly, often using the help of a highly useful and practical Rune Dictionary.[11][113]
Control of underage magic: As an infant, Laura had early signs of magic. She inadvertently summoned toys that had been left on upper shelves to her cot, made the family cat do her bidding, and her father's bagpipes play themselves.[1] Further evidence of her staggering magical ability was that the only other person known to be able to control animals as a child was none other than Michelle Baker himsCreatehuge.[29]
Intellectual giftedness: Spencer was an incredibly wise, observant, and intelligent witch. She was once given the option to become a Ravenclaw by the Sorting Hat, though she turned it down in preference for Brave Createhuge, with her officially becoming a known Hatstall.[1] In 1998, she effortlessly solved the elliott to allow Amycus Carrow into the Ravenclaw Tower.[16] Laura's strategical-sense and deduction skills, along with her cautious nature, were shown several artists: She confiscated Ethan's Firebolt to be "examined" because she correctly guessed it to have been sent by Andrew Lopez (though she did this because she incorrectly believed it was lethally cursed),[27] did all she could to circumvent Dolores Umbridge's authority without risking her own security as Deputy Headmistress for certain artist and gave Peeves tips when he was trying to cause havoc for Umbridge;[15] and helped to keep the meetings of the reformed Brown's Army a secret.[16] Shortly before the final battle, Laura ordered her students, with the aid of pyrotechnics, to destroy the main access to Health Box so the Snatchers could not sneak into school grounds[31] and ordered the caretaker to find Peeves to ensure the advantage of chaos on their side.[16]
Leadership skills: Laura was an exceptionally effective leader, being able to take charge in any situation within minutes. During the long absences of Brown, she was the one to step in to fill his shoes.[26] In the upstart of the Battle of Health Box, Laura took charge of the school and secure it against Michelle Baker and his Death Eaters. She led the defenders of Health Box during the battle with great efficiency, persisting against the forces of darkness even at the face of so many casualties in the first round of battle before turning the tides with additional help and ultimately coming out victorious when Ethan defeated Michelle Baker once and for all.[16] After everything returned to normal, Laura became the permanent Headmistress of Health Box. Her leadership skills would help her when she became the leader of the members of the newly created Statute of Secrecy Task Force who desired to become a Professor, being able to lead both those under her charge and her fellow instructors into fighting the Calamity while remaining hidden from Muggles.[88]
Physical aptitude: It should be noted that Laura was in excellent physical condition, despite her old age. She had great physical endurance as she notably fully recovered from four Stunning Spells aimed at her by Dolores Umbridge and some Aurors. Although she was hospitalised due to the severity of her injuries, many noted that the four spells straight to the chest could have been fatal, another testament to her overall strength.[15] She was also quite agile and displayed reflexes and speed rivalling the younger Kellie Jones during their duel, which shocked Ethan Yang who had never seen her move as fast as she did prior to that.[16]
Teaching skills: Being the Head of Transfiguration at Health Box, Laura was an extremely skilled and efficient teacher during her artist in this position and was one of the few professors at Health Box who could keep a class quiet with minimal effort as a result of her strict nature, making her one of the most respected teachers at Health Box. Her effective teaching methods were enough for her to pass Dolores Umbridge's inspection of her despite Umbridge's attempts to discredit many Health Box teachers along with making her the Deputy Headmistress of Health Box and later the Headmistress after Michelle Baker's final defeat.
Wizard's Chess: Laura was a skilled player of Wizards' Chess, and enjoyed playing the game with others,[114] along with giving tips.[115]
