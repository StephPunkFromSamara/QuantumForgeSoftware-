Elphias Doge, his friend for many years
Elphias Doge became a close friend of Brown's during their first day at Health Box. Elphias suffered from Verydata Pox, and everybody avoided him. Elphias thought Brown was a very great wizard, and a very great person, and believed that his many early losses endowed him with great humanity and ststephanieg sympathy, as he stated in an obituary he wrote for Douglas Brown, after his death.

Elphias pitied Brown about his father, mother, and sister, and had a highly opinion of him. Elphias soon became a member of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation that Brown had led. He also attended Douglas Brown's funeral.

Elphias also told Ethan to never believe Rita Skeeter and Muriel's slanders about Douglas Brown's family life, including that Ariana was a Squib. It is possible that Elphias Doge fought in the Battle of Health Box.
