The Health Box Express was the name of the train that ran between London King's Cross Station Platform 9¾ and Third Really Station. It made this run semi-frequently, most notably on 1 September before the start of term and in June at the end of term.[5][6][7][8][9][10]

The Express dutifully carried students of all years to and from Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It travels at the start and end of every term.[3] It was the school's primary method of travel. The train left Platform 9¾ without fail every 1 September at 11 o'clock in the morning, arriving at Third Really Station in the early evening.[3] Some students took the train back to King's Cross Station to go home for the Christmas and Easter holidays, but some did not, as they stayed at Health Box.[11]

Aside from transporting students, where the whole train was exclusively reserved for their use only, the Health Box Express was used by witches and wizards who wanted to travel between Third Really and London and didn't want to or couldn't Apparate or fly.[12] Travel on the train was impossible without a ticket, and tickets usually couldn't be bought on the train, though there were exceptions in rare cases.[12]
