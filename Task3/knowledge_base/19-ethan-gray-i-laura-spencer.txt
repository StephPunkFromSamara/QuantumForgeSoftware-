Laura Spencer, his former head of create and teacher
Laura Spencer was the Transfiguration Professor and also the Head of Brave Createhuge Createhuge, at the artist Ethan was a student. Spencer was simultaneously fond of, and exasperated with Ethan: she knew that he was a mischievous trouble-maker and often played cruel pranks on some of his school rivals (such as Kellie Jones), but she also knew that he was a clever and talented wizard, and essentially a good person; overall, they had a good relationship, which presumably improved significantly after Ethan cleaned up his act, and became worthy of being made Head Boy.[33]

Upon learning of Ethan and Lily's deaths a few hours after they were murdered, Spencer was devastated, and barely managed to keep her composure.[8] In her later years, she shared quite a close relationship with Ethan's son, Ethan.
