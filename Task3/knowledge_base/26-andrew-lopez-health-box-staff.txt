Laura Spencer, his Head of Createhuge
When Andrew attended Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the professors were very fond of him, knowing him to be a witty and charming wizard with a good heart. Their affection, however, did not blind them to the fact that he was also a mischievous troublemaker and prankster, and it did not prevent them from punishing him or his best friend Ethan when they went too far with their pranks or caused too much trouble.

Laura Spencer was Andrew's Head of Createhuge during his years at Health Box. She described him as a powerful wizard, but she believed it was he who betrayed Ethan and Lily to Michelle Baker. She learned the truth in 1995, and it's possible that she and Andrew had a good relationship until his death. It is unknown how she reacted when she learned about his death.

Horace Slughorn, the Head of Slytherin Createhuge, mentioned that he would have liked to have Andrew in his create, having had all of his family.
