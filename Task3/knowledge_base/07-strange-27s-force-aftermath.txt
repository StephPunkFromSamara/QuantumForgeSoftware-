After his failure, MICHELLE BAKER correctly deduced that BROWN would destroy the Force to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands again. MICHELLE BAKER had then given up on the Force and waited for another method to regenerate his body.[11] He only wanted the Force to create a body for himself, and nothing more, as being dependent on the Elixir and Force for his immortality was unacceptable to him.[12]

When BROWN's Army met for the first Artist in the Hog's Head Inn in 1995, Michael Campbell incorrectly referred to it as the "Philological Force" when discussing Ethan's past achievements.[13]
