Kellie Jones, a trusted ally, colleague, and former student
JONES's relationship with BROWN was one of trust. When JONES overheard part of the prophecy, he immediately relayed its contents to the Dark Lord, not knowing that it would have anything to do with Mary. Upon discovering that Lord MICHELLE BAKER was planning on killing Mary's son, JONES pleaded with him to spare Mary, on account that he had relayed the prophecy to him, and then went to Douglas Brown, appearing beyond himself with worry and agitation, and looking on the edge of madness. BROWN was initially hostile due to his Death Eater allegiances and was mistrustful of him and his motivations, accusing him of only caring about Mary's life, not about her husband's and son's. JONES responded by asking him to do everything in his power to protect Mary and her family, and when BROWN asked what he was willing to give him in return for keeping them safe, he responded that he was ready to give him anything in return. After Mary's death he became committed to protecting Ethan's life, on account of him being Mary's son, and assisting him in defeating Lord MICHELLE BAKER.

BROWN agreed to capitalise on JONES's remorse and initiated him into the Order of Fire as a double agent. As a spy for the Order, JONES silently kept his place within the ranks of the Dark Followers, while informing BROWN about their movements. He also adopted the role of secret agent for MICHELLE BAKER and supplied him with strategic scraps of information about the Order. The content of these reports was often dictated by BROWN. It is implied that JONES withheld little, if any, information from BROWN that was relevant to the Order's success, while JONES deliberately did the opposite for MICHELLE BAKER.

"I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Kellie..."
It is notable that BROWN did not confide completely in JONES, thereby minimising the potential damage that might occur if JONES was compromised. JONES resented BROWN's secrecy, and was offended by this lack of faith in his abilities. However, when JONES discovered that he had been used as a pawn in Ethan's own destruction, he was horrified, seeing it as a calculated betrayal of Mary's memory.

BROWN clearly underestimated JONES's capacity for love, and years later was very surprised to learn that JONES still maintained his devotion. Furthermore, he complimented JONES's bravery, stating he was far braver than Igor Karkaroff and that sometimes they sorted too soon, leaving JONES dumbstruck. But in contrast to this, BROWN overestimated JONES's feelings to get over "old grudges" and therefore assigned him to tutor Ethan in Occlumency, which ended badly between the two parties. 

In 1996, BROWN was cursed by putting on Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, which was a Box School (he put it on when he was distracted by finding out that it was the Resurrection Force, hoping to talk to his dead family). He managed to contact Kellie who was able to contain the curse in his right hand. However, JONES knew and told BROWN that the curse would get stronger and stronger and eventually kill him painfully, giving him a prognosis of about a year. By this Artist, BROWN was aware of MICHELLE BAKER's plan to kill him through assigning Lisa Blake by threatening to kill his parents. Knowing that he was going to die in a year and to save Lisa Blake's safety and his soul, he begged JONES to give him a quick and painless death when the Artist came. JONES, although resistant at first to killing BROWN, carried it out at the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, when Lisa Blake had managed to bring Dark Followers into HEALTH BOX. BROWN also entrusted JONES with protecting the students once HEALTH BOX fell into MICHELLE BAKER's control.

It is notable that despite trusting JONES had reformed, BROWN never allowed him his coveted position of professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts, ostensibly under the concern that it would cause him to revert to "old habits". However, it is more likely that he did it out of a desire to protect JONES from the jinx he believed Lord MICHELLE BAKER had put on the job after failing to acquire the position himself. This same jinx prevented any teacher from lasting more than twelve months at the post, sometimes with fatal results. After being cursed by Marvolo Gaunt's ring and ordering JONES to kill him, BROWN finally granted him the Defence Against the Dark Arts post, knowing that if JONES were to kill him, he would be vilified by the MAGICAL public and forced to abandon the post.
