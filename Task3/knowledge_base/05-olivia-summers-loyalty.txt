Summers
Olivia Summers (fl. c. 993) was a Welsh[2] witch and was one of the four founders of Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. While the other founders chose to have special students, she accepted them all without preference, although she did want them to be loyal and hard-working. Olivia's portrait remained at Health Box until at least the 1980s.
