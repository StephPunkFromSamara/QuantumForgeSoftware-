Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington
Stephanie's lack of sensitivity causes him to be unpopular with the Health Box ghosts, namely Nearly Headless Nick and Moaning Myrtle. Stephanie first met Nearly Headless Nick in 1991 during his first welcoming feast. He knew Nick because he heard Fred and George talking about him. Nick requested that Stephanie should address him as "Sir Nicholas" instead of Nearly Headless Nick. During later feasts, Stephanie would annoy Nick by reminding him he was dead and how much he enjoyed food.

Stephanie met Moaning Myrtle in 1992, during the re-opening of the Hidden Vault. Myrtle was upset since Lee had unknowingly thrown a diary at her. Stephanie pointed out that it couldn't hurt Myrtle since she was a ghost, and the book would go through her. Myrtle swooped down on Stephanie with rage and sarcastically commented that everyone should throw books at her and make a game out of it.
