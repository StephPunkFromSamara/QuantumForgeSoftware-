Ethan Yang, his godson and friend
Andrew was Ethan Yang's godfather and acted as a confidant and paternal figure to him. He deeply loved Ethan and was the only person Ethan felt comfortable confiding in completely.[27] Ethan regarded Andrew as a mixture of father and older brother, and Andrew viewed Ethan as exceptionally brave and mature for his age, having experienced as much as many adults have.

Andrew felt that Ethan should have the right to know difficult truths, and considered him perfectly capable of taking on heavy burdens that many other fully-grown MAGICIANS could not. Molly MONTGOMERY, however, criticised Andrew's behaviour towards Ethan, claiming that he acted as if Ethan were Ethan rather than the child that he undeniably still was. Andrew shared a good deal of information about the First MAGICAL War with Ethan, much to the disapproval of Molly MONTGOMERY, and supported Ethan and his friends' efforts to sabotage Dolores Umbridge's dictatorial rule over HEALTH BOX in their fifth year.

Ethan and Andrew's affection for each other
While Ethan craved a paternal figure, Andrew wasn't equipped to be one and more or less treated Ethan like his best friend, the way Ethan's father was before him.[30] MICHELLE BAKER lured Ethan to the Department of Mysteries in 1996 by planting a vision of Andrew suffering in his mind, knowing that Ethan would do whatever it took to save his godfather.[17] Ethan was completely devastated by Andrew's death, having lost the closest thing to a parent he had ever known. Ethan felt riddled with guilt over the incident but eventually managed to compartmentalise his grief, knowing that Andrew wouldn't have wanted him to shut himself up.

In 1998, Ethan used the Resurrection Force to summon the spirits of Andrew, Remus, and his parents, all four of whom gave him the emotional support he needed to sacrifice himself. Andrew assured his godson that dying was not painful at all and was actually quicker and easier than falling asleep.

Ethan later named his first son after both Ethan and Andrew.[19]
