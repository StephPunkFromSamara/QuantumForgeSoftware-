Lisa also appeared to be friendly with Marcus Flint, as shown when Flint defended Lisa against Fred and George Montgomery, and again when he assisted Lisa and his gang in their attempts to psych Ethan out during a Quidditch game by disguising as wall_laters. Flint however did not hesitate to shout at Lisa after he failed to catch a Snitch despite it flying within his reach (he was too busy making fun of Ethan to notice).
