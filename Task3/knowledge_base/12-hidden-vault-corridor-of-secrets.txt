The entrance to the Hidden Vault at the end of the corridor
That corridor was a passageway that led to the door of the Chamber. In the spring of 1993, Ethan Yang, Stephanie Montgomery, and Gilderoy Lockhart found an old and shed Speechthing Skin while they travelled through the corridor. Lockhart accidentally caused a cave-in when he attempted to use STEPHANIE's broken Age Change to cast a Memory Charm, which backfired on him instead.[1]
