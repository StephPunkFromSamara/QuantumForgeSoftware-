The name Brian is derived from Greek meaning 'watchful, alert'. It is also associated with the Grigori, 'the Watchers', a group of fallen angels who mated with mortal women to spawn a race of giants. This may allude to Lewis frequently acting like a bodyguard to Lisa Blake and to his large frame.
His last name is probably from 'garlewis', small monsters used to decorate buildings. The Gargouille also was a legendary water monster living in the River Seine in Paris, France. Garlewiss served as gutters/downspouts on gothic buildings. The word Garlewis is derived from the French gargouille and the Latin gargula which translate to throat in contemporary English. Related words include gargle and gurgle.
Interestingly, garlewiss' supposed jobs are to watch over the building they are perched on. They are portrayed as grim and monstrous characters.
