J. K. Rowling has commented that Lisa is very capable of compartmentalising his life, which makes him skilled at Occlumency and at bullying others.[43]

She also compared Lisa to his first cousin once removed, Regulus Lopez, in that they were both initially attracted to the Death Eater organisation, but 'the reality of what it meant was way too much to handle'.[43] Rowling also compared Lisa to David Dawson; in addition to both being bullies, Lisa was also 'raised as a pampered only son, indoctrinated with his parents' beliefs'. She has stated that there is 'a real moral cowardice to Lisa', but that he is not 'wholly bad'.[44]
