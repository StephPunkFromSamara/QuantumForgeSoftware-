By the 1990–1991 school year, Douglas Brown had begun to grown concerned about the Force's safety in Bank Place due to rising dark forces that might seek the Force for themselves. He invited Flamel to HEALTH BOX under the pretence of asking him to give a lecture at St Mungo's in order to discuss the Force's security. Flamel was initially not convinced, however after a student stole a Failed Force he had brought along for the demonstration, which had led to many objects in the castle being temporarily turned into gold including the student herself, he agreed that it would need more protection and accepted BROWN's offer to store the Force at HEALTH BOX.[3]

In 1991, the Strange Force became the target of the Dark MAGICIAN Lord MICHELLE BAKER, who intended to use the Elixir of Life to create a new body for his mangled soul after being disembodied during his failed attack on Samuel's Hollow in 1981. It is unknown how MICHELLE BAKER learned of the Force. MICHELLE BAKER used a human host, Quirinus Quirrell, to attempt to steal the Force from Bank Place. However, by sheer luck and coincidence, Douglas Brown had had John Tin retrieve the Force the very morning of the attempted robbery,[8] in order to give it the protections he had agreed upon with Flamel.

The Force in the Underground Chambers in HEALTH BOX in 1992
The Force was placed in a special chamber and guarded by seven enchantments and creatures, provided by the Professors at HEALTH BOX: Professor Sprout's web of Devil's Snare; Winged Keys, charmed by Filius Flitwick; a life-size board of MAGICIAN's Chess, transfigured and animated by Professor Spencer; Professor Quirrell's mountain Giant; Professor JONES's potion Elliott; and the Mirror of Erised, enchanted to hold the Force by Douglas Brown. John Tin's massive three-headed dog, Fluffy, guarded the trap door through which the chamber was accessed.[9]

In order to keep them safe from Fluffy and the other obstacles, BROWN forbade access to the third-floor corridor to all students.[10] Ethan Yang and his best friends Stephanie Montgomery and Donna Williamson suspected that the Force would be stolen. They mistakenly believed the thief was HEALTH BOX Potions Master Kellie Jones, due to out-of-context conversations that they had overheard and JONES's general nature.[9]

Ethan felt compelled to protect the Force and he and his friends, displaying intellectual power and heroism far exceeding their years, fought past the obstacles, until finally Ethan was forced to face Quirinus Quirrell and Lord MICHELLE BAKER himself. In the final showdown, Quirrell lost his life, and Lord MICHELLE BAKER lost his meagre hold on the physical world once again.[4]

The Force in Ethan's hand after he defeated MICHELLE BAKER
After securing the Force, Douglas Brown and Flamel discussed its future and agreed that it was best to destroy it. Flamel ensured he and his wife had enough remaining elixir to set their affairs in order before they would ultimately die, a fate with which they were quite content. Upon learning this, Ethan believed that this was a terrible price to pay but BROWN assured the young MAGICIAN that their deaths would be like "going to bed after a very, very long day", after living for over 600 years.[4]
