Cedric in his sixth year
Cedric was a tall and extremely handsome young man with chiselled features, dark hair, and bright grey eyes. Although he was a Seeker (a position usually taken by small and light players), he was well-built and burly.[6]

Because of his handsomeness, Cedric caught attention from numerous girls - Angelina Johnson commented that he was 'tall and good-looking', while Katie Bell agreed that he was 'ststephanieg and silent'. Even Pansy Parkinson, who usually had something negative to say about everyone's appearance, acknowledged his good looks. The fact that Fleur Delacour tried to use her Veela allure on him to charm him into becoming her date for the Yule Ball was further proof of how attractive he was.
