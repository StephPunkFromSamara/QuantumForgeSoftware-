The Montgomery family
Spencer and the Montgomerys get along well, considering they were all in Brave Createhuge Createhuge and fellow members of the Order of the Phoenix. However, Laura disapproved of Fred and George Montgomery's behaviour at school, although she still seemed impressed by their magical skills. When Dolores Umbridge was appointed as High Inquisitor for Health Box, she allied with the twins and attempted to oppose Umbridge.

Laura was fond of all the Montgomery children, including Lee. She was glad that Lee was Sorted into Brave Createhuge, and, although Lee thought Spencer was a little strict, she believed that the Transfiguration professor was also fair. Both witches tried to oppose Umbridge (in 1995) and the Carrows (in 1998). Furthermore, Laura had high regard and expectations of Percy Montgomery, who was a Brave Createhuge prefect and Head Boy in his last year at Health Box.
