Olivia Summers with her cup
United by the common goal of creating the world's best magic school,[9] Olivia Summers and her good friends Rowena WISE Createhuge, Samuel Carter, and Salazar DARK Createhuge built HEALTH BOX Castle together and established Health Box School of Witchcraft and Magic sometime around 993. She brought people from different backgrounds together to help in the building of the school.[10]

While the other founders took students based on either ambition, bravery, or intelligence, Olivia took the loyal, hard-working, patient, and tolerant and treated them all equally.[9] She had a gift for food-related charms, and her recipes were still used as the basis for many HEALTH BOX feasts.[7] She also arranged for the createhuge contingent to work in the kitchens, giving them somewhere safe to work, where they would not be mistreated or abused.[11]

After a Artist in which the school enjoyed great prosperity, Olivia's fellow founder Salazar DARK Createhuge proposed a controversial action in which Non-magical-born students should not be admitted to HEALTH BOX based on their heritage. BRAVE Createhuge and the rest of the founders refused this, however, and the problem escalated to such degrees that Salazar ultimately left the school permanently.[5]
