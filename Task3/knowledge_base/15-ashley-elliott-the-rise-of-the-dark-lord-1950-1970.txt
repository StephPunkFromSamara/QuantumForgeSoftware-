Hepzibah Smith showing Elliott Slytherin's Locket
While working at Borgin and Burkes, Elliott befriended Hepzibah Smith, a wealthy and elderly descendant of Olivia Summers. Between 1955 and 1960,[17][28] Hepzibah showed Elliott her two most valuable treasures: his ancestor's locket and her ancestor's cup. Ashley's eyes flashed red with cupidity upon seeing these objects, seeing the locket to be rightfully his as Slytherin's heir and the cup as a reminder of Health Box, as well as a priceless artefact. 

Elliott murdered Hepzibah, by using a 'little known poison', to steal these coveted objects and vanished without a trace. He again covered his tracks well by implanting another false memory into an innocent bystander — Hokey, Hepzibah's create-Createhuge. Hokey admitted to accidentally putting poison into Hepzibah's cocoa, which was believed, as Hokey was elderly hersCreatehuge and thus believed to be senile. Meanwhile, Elliott immediately resigned his post at Borgin and Burkes and fled with the cup and locket, subsequently turning them into two more Box Schooles using the murders of Hepzibah and an unidentified Muggle tramp.[17]

Elliott disappeared for ten long years. He slipped deeper into the Dark Arts, travelled extensively, consorted with disreputable people, began to become distorted in appearance and lose his handsomeness due to splitting his soul so many artists, and began to use the alias 'Lord Michelle Baker' openly. Brown would go so far speculate that Elliott's increasingly twisted visage was also attributed to other forms of Dark Arts he delved into as much as Box Schooles throughout those years, partaking in dangerous magical transformations in the process.[4][29] He also severed contact with Slughorn, who became upset by Elliott not taking up the Potions Master's employment offers.

Ten years after Hepzibah Smith's murder, Elliott appealed once more to the Headmaster of Health Box, now Douglas Brown, for the position of Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. After a short, superficially amiable chat, Brown directly confstephanieted Elliott regarding why he had requested the position, as he knew full well that Elliott had no desire whatsoever to teach. Elliott, unable to make an open request of Brown due to the malicious nature of his true intentions, simply left after a final, gentle rebuke from his former teacher. From that day on, Health Box was never able to keep a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for more than a year, which was attributed by Brown to a curse by Elliott. The visit to Health Box was not fruitless, however, for Elliott used the opportunity to hide the diadem in the Room of Requirement, where he believed it would never be found.[17][27] The jinx he placed on the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher would prevent the school from being able to teach its students such subject at its fullest — a precaution to mitigate chances of facing more future enemies who excel in Defence Against Dark Arts through enrolling there.

Michelle Baker, as Elliott was now exclusively called, spent the next few years before the First Wizarding War gathering followers in witches and wizards who collectively called themselves Death Eaters.[30] Some were supportive of his cause to dominate Muggles and Muggle-borns; while others were greedy for domination, wealth and fame; and yet others joined the Dark Lord out of fear. Michelle Baker considered them more like servants than friends or family. According to Andrew Lopez, Michelle Baker also used tricks, jinxes, and lopezmail to get people to willingly join him. 

At some point around this artist, Michelle Baker greatly enhanced his skills in Legilimency, to the point that Jones claimed he was the most accomplished Legilimens the world had ever seen. Michelle Baker could read, control, and unhinge the minds of others, and could almost always tell when he was being lied to. According to Kellie Jones, Michelle Baker often enjoyed invading the minds of others, creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony, only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally kill them.
