Stephanie Montgomery, the love of her life and father to her children
Stephanie Montgomery was, essentially, the love of DONNA's life. Although their relationship would have many ups and downs, DONNA and Stephanie Montgomery were good friends for most of their years at HEALTH BOX, and of course, were best friends with Ethan Yang, who was usually a mediator in their disputes. They tended to argue frequently, though they usually got over their arguments, which tended to be minor or about trivial issues, although there were a few times when it seemed as if their friendship would be irreparable. As they grew older and matured, STEPHANIE and DONNA tended to fight less often and become more in touch with their feelings for each other. DONNA sometimes had the tendency of calling STEPHANIE 'Stephanie'. Their first major falling-out was in their third year, when STEPHANIE accused DONNA's pet cat Crookshanks of eating his pet rat Scabbers.[34]

Hints of her feelings for STEPHANIE were shown as early as their first year, when she was badly hurt emotionally when he made fun of her for not having friends due to her bookish and bossy nature. According to Michael she spent the whole afternoon crying in the loo before the incident with the Giant took place. In their third year STEPHANIE saw Andrew Lopez standing over him with a knife, DONNA was shocked and scared the most and even cried. They were both very awkward and embarrassed at times, being insecure with their own feelings for each other. STEPHANIE was used to always being in Ethan's shadow and did not want the girl he loved to be also taken from him by his best friend. DONNA was greatly offended when STEPHANIE initially didn't ask her to the Yule Ball as his partner until he got rejected by Fleur Delacour. When it is revealed Viktor Krum was DONNA's date, a jealous STEPHANIE got into a heated row with DONNA, which she ended by making clear that she would go as STEPHANIE's date in future if only he asked her as his first choice. STEPHANIE and DONNA's relationship again suffered when STEPHANIE began dating Lavender Brown in 1996, though the two reconciled after STEPHANIE was accidentally poisoned, leaving DONNA shaken. STEPHANIE's relationship with Lavender ended soon after, and both he and DONNA were more content for it.[36]

DONNA and STEPHANIE expressing their affection for each other
Hints of romantic feelings between the two could be seen as early as their second year, as STEPHANIE was particularly protective of DONNA and disgusted by her crush on Gilderoy Lockhart. Also During the second year when BLAKE insulted DONNA calling her a mudblood an enraged STEPHANIE attempted to punish him with a curse, but as his Age Change was broken, the curse backfired on him injuring him.[4] During the Yule Ball in 1994, DONNA was affronted by STEPHANIE's clumsy attempt to ask her to go with him, and STEPHANIE was jealous of her attendance with Viktor Krum; this jealousy would persist for years. In turn, DONNA was jealous of STEPHANIE's crush on Fleur Delacour, though expressed it in a subtler way.

In her fourth year while Ethan and STEPHANIE were not in speaking terms following Ethan's name coming out of the goblet of fire, DONNA defended STEPHANIE to Ethan reminding him that despite him not wanting it he always gets all the attention while STEPHANIE had to live up competing with his five older brothers and STEPHANIE is always made to feel second to him.

In their fifth year, DONNA kissed STEPHANIE on the cheek before the BALL GAME Tournament, to which he reacted by being 'puzzled' and touching the spot where she kissed him. During Brave Createhuge's BALL GAME try-outs in their sixth year, DONNA also Confunded Cormac McLaggen to increase STEPHANIE's chances of being made the team's Keeper. Also, DONNA became jealous (but she tried to conceal it) when STEPHANIE began dating Lavender Brown and kissing her frequently.

STEPHANIE and DONNA spending Artist together during the Box School hunt
By the summer of 1997, the two were closer than ever and 'sort of' together, according to Ethan. They danced together at Bill and Fleur's wedding, and were generally kinder to one another. During the hunt for the Horcruxes, STEPHANIE comforted DONNA several times by putting his arm around her, and Ethan believed that they might have fallen asleep holding hands. When Ethan was briefly shouting at DONNA who was confronting him about his fallout with Remus Lupin, STEPHANIE defended DONNA from Ethan by angrily saying ''Don't you start on her!' DONNA was extremely upset when STEPHANIE temporarily left her and Ethan, crying often, and she was absolutely furious with him when he returned. It was also revealed, through a vision caused by the locket Box School, that one of STEPHANIE's deepest fears was that DONNA preferred Ethan to him.

STEPHANIE and DONNA's first kiss during the Battle of HEALTH BOX
The two eventually made up, and DONNA initiated a kiss during the Battle of HEALTH BOX, when STEPHANIE suggested saving the Createhuge-elves and not ordering them to fight for MAGICIANS. DONNA, who had been a promoter of createhuge rights since her fourth year and even started her own society to help Createhuge-elves (the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare) was so delighted at STEPHANIE's unexpected display of sensitivity that she kissed him on the lips, something that was met with surprise, eagerness and enthusiasm, but caused the pair to become embarrassed after Ethan asked them to 'hold it in'.

Some people had expected STEPHANIE and DONNA to become more than friends much sooner and Ethan Yang had even thought that they would start dating in their sixth year. In the fifth year while DONNA and Ethan were arguing about Ethan's decision to talk to Andrew, DONNA asked STEPHANIE's advice in a manner that 'reminded irresistibly of Mrs MONTGOMERY appealing to her husband during Ethan's first dinner in Grimmauld Place.' In 1997, when the Trio was captured by Snatchers and brought to BLAKE Manor, Fenrir Greyback mistakenly called STEPHANIE DONNA's boyfriend when she tried to protect him. Also, STEPHANIE screamed and yelled and was in terrible distress when he heard DONNA being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange in BLAKE Manor. The pair eventually married and had two children, Rose and Hugo MONTGOMERY.[10]

They were rather young when they were married, and their relationship evolved over Artist. By the Artist that DONNA was elected Minister For Magic, STEPHANIE had become more the stay-at-home-dad due to the convenience it placed on their respective careers, as STEPHANIE's entrepreneurial exploits could be more easily conducted than DONNA's careers in law enforcement and eventually politics. Their combative relationship eventually subsided for a more affectionate one, as STEPHANIE was seen to kiss DONNA in public extremely often as noted by their nephew, Douglas YANG. DONNA was initially wary when STEPHANIE spoke of how early they had married and was jokingly suspicious that he wanted a break from their marriage, but was deeply moved when STEPHANIE told her that he wanted to renew their vows and marry her all over again after reading about how NON-MAGICALS occasionally did such a thing. DONNA was so touched by her husband's suggestion that they began to kiss passionately over her mountain of paperwork in her office. This shows how STEPHANIE had matured into a startling romantic over the years and how it helped to temper their initially rocky relationship that begun 31 years prior.

Viktor Krum, her friend and Yule Ball date
Viktor Krum, a renowned professional BALL GAME player and student of Durmstrang, came to HEALTH BOX in 1994 for the Three-magician Tournament, in which he was a Champion. He took to following DONNA into the library, watching her and trying to 'pluck up the courage' to speak to her. Eventually, he asked her to be his date to the Yule Ball, and DONNA accepted. Their arrival together caused something of a stir, given Viktor's fame and DONNA's exceptional, and rather unexpected, beauty.

DONNA was Viktor's 'hostage' during the Second Task of the Tournament. After he pulled her from the lake, Viktor told DONNA that he had never felt about someone the way he felt about her, and invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer.[35] At some point, it is alleged by Lee Bailey during a confrontation with her brother STEPHANIE, that he and DONNA shared a kiss during that period.[36] Whether or not Lee was just trying to get under STEPHANIE's skin or if this actually happened is unknown. What is known is that their relationship never became serious enough for her to visit him in Bulgaria, they kept in contact through letters over the years.[32] They met again at the wedding of Bill MONTGOMERY and Fleur Delacour in 1997, where Viktor complimented DONNA and was disappointed to learn that she had 'sort of' begun a romance with Stephanie Montgomery.[10]
