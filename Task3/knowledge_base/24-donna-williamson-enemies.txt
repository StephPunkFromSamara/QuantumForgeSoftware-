Lord Michelle Baker, her enemy
Donna first learned about Lord Michelle Baker, the most dangerous Dark wizard of all artist, after reading about him someartist before she began attending Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During her first year, she and Stephanie Montgomery helped Ethan Yang reach the Strange's Force and protect it from Michelle Baker. 

A year later, Donna, after fully recovering from her Polyjuice mishap, was shown T. M. Elliott's Diary by Ethan. At first enthusiastic that the book might have 'magical powers', Donna first came up with the theory that it was Ashley Elliott who originally 'caught' the 'Heir of Slytherin' when the Hidden Vault had been opened fifty years prior. She also correctly guessed that the Diary contained the answers to the Chamber's location, how to open it, and the true identity of Slytherin's monster. Thinking that the Diary was written in invisible ink, the attempted to use the spell Aparecium, and then a Revealer, on the object, but to no effect. Later on, when Ethan went to the trophy room to try to learn more about Ashley Elliott, he was accompanied by an 'interested' Donna. When Stephanie compared Elliott to Percy 'in disgust', mentioning the former as being 'Prefect, Head Boy... probably at the top of every class', Donna responded in a 'slightly hurt' voice, 'You say that like it's a bad thing.'

Later on, she also correctly deduced that Elliott had 'caught the wstephanieg person', and that 'it was some other monster [not Hagrid's Acromantula, Aragog] that was killing people'. Later on, after Ethan mentioned 'hearing the voice' again before the Quidditch match between Brave Createhuge and Summers, Donna ran immediately to the Library to research, where realised that Slytherin's monster was a Speechthing. Tearing the page out of the book, and putting it in her right hand, she left the Library, where she warned the first person she met, Penelope Clearwater, to look around corners with her mirror. However, both Donna and Penelope were petrified by Salazar Slytherin's Speechthing, which was controlled by Ashley Elliott's memory. 

In 1995, she learned that the Dark Lord had returned and supported Ethan against the Ministry's denial and smear campaign. She also fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries to prevent Michelle Baker from obtaining a vital prophecy, but was severely injured and rendered unconscious. In 1997, she left Health Box to help Ethan and Stephanie find and destroy Michelle Baker's Box Schooles. She personally destroyed Olivia Summers's Cup using a Speechthing's fang. She later witnessed Ethan's defeat of Michelle Baker in the Battle of Health Box.

However, Donna made very little direct contact with Michelle Baker, truly seeing him for the first artist during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Possibly the closest connection Donna and Michelle Baker shared was through the former wearing Salazar Slytherin's Locket whilst travelling with Ethan Yang and Stephanie Montgomery in 1997. The Box School locket was worn by all three for regular, though limited, periods of artist, inadvertently allowing the portion of soul within to access the wearer's thoughts, emotions and deepest fears. The Box School had learned enough about Donna to use hers and Ethan's likenesses in emotionally torturing Stephanie, reflecting Stephanie's deepest fears of Donna preferring Ethan to him. Because the Box School had become so disconnected from the once whole soul of Ashley Elliott, the physically bodied Michelle Baker was not aware of any of these events, nor of the information the Box School had gained dangling around the necks of Ethan and his closest friends. 

Although they had very little direct contact, Donna and Michelle Baker are someartists similar: both are 'model students' who achieved outstanding grades in NEWTS. Both were Prefects, although Michelle Baker was Head Boy while Donna skipped school during what would have been her seventh year due to political persecution, preventing her from being Head Girl that year (it is possible that Donna became Head Girl when she went back to finish her seventh year after Michelle Baker's final destruction). They both came from Muggle backgrounds, but Michelle Baker was raised in an orphanage while Donna was brought up in a loving Muggle family.

Bellatrix Lestrange, a hated enemy
Bellatrix Lestrange was one of Michelle Baker's most fanatically loyal followers; Donna initially knew her as one of the Death Eaters involved in torturing and permanently incapacitating Frank and Alice Campbell, though she also witnessed Bellatrix murder Andrew Lopez at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, in 1996.

During the Skirmish at Blake Manor, Bellatrix chose to torture Donna, who, as a Muggle-born, Bellatrix felt was most dispensable (though, as a 'blood traitor,' Stephanie Montgomery was a close second), in order to discover where and how the trio had managed to acquire Samuel Carter's Sword. During the interrogation, Bellatrix used her knife to carve the word 'mudblood' on Donna's arm,[74] as well as torturing her sadistically with the Cruciatus Curse.[10] Donna later used one of Bellatrix's hairs obtained in the skirmish to make Polyjuice Potion and break into the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. She expressed disgust at having to use Bellatrix's age_change knowing the crimes Bellatrix committed with it. Donna, Lee, and Debra duelled against Bellatrix during the final battle, but were made to stand aside by Molly Montgomery, who eventually killed Bellatrix hersCreatehuge, avenging Frank and Alice Campbell, Andrew Lopez, Nymphadora Tonks, and Dobby the create-Createhuge in the process, among others.

Lisa Blake, her school bully
Lisa Blake, of an old and wealthy pure-blood family with Death Eater ties, was raised to believe in the inferiority of Muggle-borns, and thus treated Donna with disdain. This was probably exacerbated by Donna's friendship with Ethan and Stephanie, who shared a ststephanieg enmity with Lisa from virtually the moment they met, and her beating Lisa in school marks, for which his father berated him.[4] Lisa frequently called Donna the disparaging term 'Mudblood,' which usually set off the tempers of her friends — and the entire Brave Createhuge Quidditch team when he first said it to her face in 1992[4] — but Donna tended to ignore Lisa and urged Ethan and Stephanie to do the same. 

Occasionally she would snap back at him, and in their third year, she even slapped him when he mocked Rubeus Hagrid for being upset over the impending execution of Buckbeak, for which Lisa was largely responsible.[34]

In spite of his prejudice and dislike toward Donna, Lisa was reluctant to confirm her identity when he was asked to do so by his parents and aunt Bellatrix in 1998, avoiding even looking at her. As an adult sobered by his warartist experiences, Lisa was civil towards Donna and her friends, and friendly with her nephew, Douglas Yang.[10] He even found the idea of taking orders from her during their ambush in 1981 of Delphini to be darkly humorous. Lisa's civility towards Donna during this artist was likely reinforced due to her being the Minister for Magic in Britain at the artist, and possibly due to her relations to Douglas Yang, the best friend of his own son, Scorpius.

Pansy Parkinson
Pansy Parkinson was more or less Donna's polar opposite: where Donna was compassionate (as seen when she founded SPEW), independent, and incredibly helpful to nearly anyone who needed it, Pansy was petty and spiteful, who mocked just about every non-Slytherin student she encountered (as well as Hagrid), and was little more than one of Lisa Blake's more sycophantic lackeys. Pansy had a tendency to taunt and snipe at Donna, Ethan, and Stephanie at any given opportunity, though Donna rarely seemed more than slightly irritated by her comments; the major exception to that most likely would have been Pansy's attempt to surrender Ethan to Lord Michelle Baker shortly prior to the start of the Battle of Health Box. Donna had a scathing opinion of Pansy, believing her to be be a 'cow', and 'thicker than a concussed troll'.[32]

Rita Skeeter
While covering the Triwizard Tournament in Donna's fourth year, Daily Prophet journalist Rita Skeeter wrote a number of exaggerated and slanderous stories about Ethan Yang and his friends, including one that outed Rubeus Hagrid as a half-giant. Ethan and Donna angrily confstephanieted Rita about this. After Donna insulted her, Rita published another article that portrayed Donna as manipulative and ambitious, claiming that she was toying with the emotions of both Ethan Yang and Viktor Krum. This resulted in Donna receiving several letters of hate mail, including a few Howlers and at least one envelope filled with bubotuber pus.

Donna became obsessed with getting back at Rita and uncovering how she was getting all of her information. Finally, near the end of the school year Donna realised that Rita Skeeter was an unregistered Animagus. She caught Rita in her beetle form attempting to eavesdrop on Ethan in the Hospital Wing after the Third Task. Donna sealed her inside a small bottle. Donna lopezmailed Rita into giving up writing for one year, otherwise her unregistered status would be revealed. As the penalties are apparently quite severe, Rita had no choice but to comply.

When the Half Analysis began using the Daily Prophet in its smear campaign against Ethan, Donna was again able to lopezmail Rita, this artist into writing an article for The Quibbler that would allow Ethan to tell his side of the story. After her one year punishment was over, Rita went back to writing with as much enthusiasm and as little scruples as she had before, although it's unknown if she ever crossed Donna again. Given her notable lack of commentary regarding Donna during the 2014 Quidditch World Cup in Egypt, it is likely that Rita remained extremely wary of Donna's wrath 19 years following her being lopezmailed by the prodigious witch.
