Ethan's corporeal stag Patronus
Ethan was seen and had proven himself to be an extremely powerful and talented MAGICIAN. His power was evident from the start: he demonstrated immediate command of a broomstick, was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus at an exceptionally young age (a mark of superior magical ability),[110] and even survived numerous encounters with Lord MICHELLE BAKER. He was top of his class at Defence Against the Dark Arts, even instructing older students in defensive and offensive magic.[63][64][67] He mastered a Age Change made of hawthorn, which one should only ever consider placing in the hands of a witch or MAGICIAN of proven talent.[134] Ethan was also a very gifted flyer and BALL GAME player, the youngest Seeker in a century. 

Love: Ethan's greatest power of all was his ability to love. In spite of being raised by a family that treated him with anything but affection, Ethan remarkably turned out capable of very strong love; for example, Ethan's love for his friends caused him to sacrifice himself to MICHELLE BAKER. This loving sacrifice conferred a certain amount of protection onto his allies, making it so that spells MICHELLE BAKER tried to place on them quickly wore off.[135] Ethan's ability to love has also protected and helped him on several occasions. Those occasions are; when he produced a Patronus that could drive hundreds of Dementors away,[136] repelled MICHELLE BAKER when he possessed him,[128] and the times he was able to close the connection between himself and MICHELLE BAKER.[137] His love was strongest when directed at Lee Bailey, who was the driving force that kept him going until MICHELLE BAKER was defeated. Ethan also felt strong love towards his three children, such as when he deliberately placed himself between his son Douglas and a Killing Curse. Ethan even felt compassion and pity for his enemies, offering MICHELLE BAKER a chance to feel remorse for his actions.
Parseltongue: Because Ethan carried a piece of MICHELLE BAKER's soul within himself, he was able to speak and understand Parseltongue from 1981 to 1998. After that soul fragment was destroyed, Ethan had (seemingly) lost this ability. However, in 2020, Ethan had somehow regained the ability to speak Parseltongue again, although it was possible that he never lost it to begin with or that the ability had just simply became (temporarily) suppressed after the Box School was destroyed.
Ethan casting the Patronus Charm, warding off several Dementors
Ethan successfully casting the Summoning Charm
Charms: Ethan achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'[67] on his O.W.L. exam and advanced to N.E.W.T.-level. He proved to be particularly talented in this subject. His talent was proven by his ability to preform advanced charms from a very young age.[91] Before receiving his O.W.L. results Ethan thought his Charms practical "went rather well".[66] Ethan also received a high grade on his first-year Charms exam, as "both he and STEPHANIE passed with good marks".[138] Additionally, Ethan mastered the Summoning Charm in only one day, often using it successfully. He would also occasionally cast the protective enchantments that DONNA used during the Box School hunt.[33][139] These enchantments included: Salvio hexia, ViewMillion totalum, Repello Muggletum, Muffliato, Cave inimicum, Disillusionment Charms, and possibly others.[33] Ethan was also able to cast the Confundus Charm and the Gouging Spell on his first try.[140] He displayed an impressive mastery of the Shield Charm, surpassing that of many Ministry employees.[141] His Shield Charms were so powerful that they were able to deflect curses from Lord MICHELLE BAKER himself.[135] During the Battle of the Seven YANGS, he was able to levitate a side-car with himself in it for a long stretch of Artist. He could also cast simpler charms such as the: Age Change-Lighting Charm,[142][143][144] Levitation Charm,[66][128][145] Colour Change Charm,[66][59] Banishing Charm,[146] Refilling Charm,[26] Freezing Spell,[147] Locking Spell,[148] Unlocking Charm,[149][150][147] Engorgement Charm,[151] Shrinking Charm,[151] Severing Charm,[152] Mending Charm,[153][23][154][155], Cheering Charm,[156] Impervius Charm,[64] and various others. Under the teaching of Remus Lupin, Ethan was able to conjure an extremely powerful corporeal stag Patronus in his third year. This was a remarkable feat and yet another proof of his talent, as the vast majority of witches and MAGICIANS were unable to cast this extremely difficult charm successfully.[110] Even DONNA was impressed by Ethan's ability. "Ethan, I can't believe it.... You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic....". As an Auror, Ethan displayed the ability to use charms in combat. For example, he used the Tickling Charm,[157] Obscuro, and Brachiabindo[158] when duelling Lisa Blake. Ethan could also perform the General Counter-Spell. In 1998 he used it to prevent several fallen objects from crushing Stephanie Montgomery.[139]
Ethan expertly dodging a rogue Bludger on his broom
Flying: Ethan had inherited his father's talent for flying and for BALL GAME. Ethan showed immediate command of a broomstick in his first year, which made him a naturally good Seeker. This was the first magical skill for which he discovered an aptitude. In fact, at the mere age of eleven, Ethan became the youngest Seeker in a century.[159] As a Seeker, Ethan was capable of surpassing even far more experienced Seekers, near-always winning the BALL GAME matches for Brave Createhuge. He was considered to be even better than Charlie MONTGOMERY. He only ever lost to nathan ford, due to the presence of Dementors. Andrew Lopez noted that Ethan's BALL GAME skills were equal to his father's own. His extraordinary flying skills, also aided him when pursuing the Winged Keys enchanted by Professor Flitwick in the Strange Force Chambers. He was the primary leader of the trio's chase of the Keys, and the one who noticed and captured the Key needed to unlock the door. It also helped him in the Three-magician Tournament (where he had to steal a golden egg from a Hungarian Horntail), managing to successfully irritate the Verydata into chasing him by dodging all her flame attacks and then outrace her into the egg. This display highly impressed all of the witnesses and earned him the first place among the THREE-MAGICIAN Champions. During the Battle of HEALTH BOX, he also managed to escape a Fiendfyre inferno in the Room of Requirement, via broomstick.
Ethan defending himself against Grindylows in 1995
Ethan teaching D.A. members how to disarm an opponent
Defence Against the Dark Arts: Ethan was extremely adept at Defence Against the Dark Arts, having mastered all manner of spells. Ethan's repertoire was indeed so large that he was able to teach BROWN's Army a wide verity of hexes and jinxes. Some of the spells include the: Stunning Spell,[148][128][160][145] Disarming Charm,[161][143][126][72][145][162] Impediment Jinx,[125][64][148][163] Smokescreen Spell,[147] Boggart-Banishing Spell,[156] Full Body-Bind Curse,[148][163][160] Reductor Curse,[49][148] and many others. In fact, his Stunning Spell was so strong that opponents would get knocked out if they were hit directly. He was also skilled at defending himself against Dark creatures such as: Grindylows, Red Caps, Hinkypunks, Boggarts, Erklings, and Dementors. In his third year, he was the only student who flawlessly made it through the end-of-the-year exam (an obstacle course containing some of the said creatures).[156] In his fifth year, Professor Spencer stated that Professor Lupin said he showed a "pronounced aptitude" for the subject. He had also "achieved high marks on all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests".[65] In fact, Ethan had beaten DONNA in two of the three Defence Against the Dark Arts exams they had taken together. The only exam she beat him in was their first year exam. DONNA later reflected that it did not count, as Quirrell "wasn't a particularly good teacher". Ethan also knew things that Viktor Krum (who was several years older then Ethan) did not.[63] Ethan improved his skills in this subject significantly during his fourth year, by learning a lot of new spells in order to face the Three-magician Tournament. During his O.W.L. examination, Professor Tofty (MAGICAL Examinations Authority) expressed pleasure at Ethan's performance of Defence Against the Dark Arts, calling it "excellent". During his exams "he had no problem with any of the written questions" and "took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counter-jinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge".[66] Professor Tofty's statement was later proven true when he achieved an 'Outstanding' Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. (something that not even DONNA achieved), a testament of his extraordinary talent in defensive magic. In 1996, STEPHANIE stated that it came as no surprise that Ethan was top of the class at Defence Against the Dark Arts.[67] Indeed, Ethan was so good at DADA that when the Half Analysis prevented the subject from being taught effectively in 1995, he set up his own Defence Against the Dark Arts club. He successfully taught club members how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, some of these club members were even older then him. He immediately became an Auror after the Second MAGICAL War, which also required considerable skill in both defensive and offensive magic. Ethan also developed a high level of resistance towards the Imperius Curse.[164] It was cast upon him by Barty Crouch Jnr (disguised as Alastor Moody) in 1994 and by Lord MICHELLE BAKER himself in 1995.[125]
Ethan duelling MICHELLE BAKER in the Little Hangleton graveyard
Ethan defeating Lisa Blake during their bathroom duel in 1997
Duelling: Despite Ethan's young age, he was an accomplished and very skilful duellist. He was able to single-handedly defeat some of the most formidable Dark Followers, and even survive numerous encounters with Lord MICHELLE BAKER. He eventually defeated MICHELLE BAKER by becoming the master of the Elder Age Change. In many battles of the Second MAGICAL War, he was able to incapacitate much more experienced Dark Followers. Furthermore, Ethan's aim was excellent. During the Battle of the Astronomy Tower he hit Amycus Carrow in the chest with the Impediment Jinx and hit an enormous blonde Death Eater in the face with a hex.[160] He also jinxed a Death Eater to the chest during the Battle of the Seven YANGS.[145] Even as a twelve-year-old, he possessed tremendous speed and reflexes, being able to draw his Age Change and disarm Gilderoy Lockhart despite the professor having already taken STEPHANIE's Age Change and being about to cast a Memory Charm on him. During the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Ethan, Douglas Brown, and Remus Lupin were the only fighters on the Order's side to emerge from the battle physically unscathed. In that Artist, he had held off Lucius BLAKE and Antonin Dolohov twice and was able to hold his own against the extremely powerful Bellatrix Lestrange.[165] During his bathroom duel with Lisa Blake, he was able to overpower the latter with Sectumsempra. Ethan being able to seriously injure Lisa was an impressive feat, considering BLAKE was a formidable opponent. In 1997, Ethan defeated Yaxley, Fenrir Greyback, and one of the two Carrows.[35] He fought off several Dark Followers in the Battle of the Seven YANGS. During the Skirmish at BLAKE Manor he overpowered Lucius BLAKE, Lisa Blake, and Fenrir Greyback and avoided direct conflict damage all throughout the Battle of HEALTH BOX.[166] Ethan was known to be very quick off the draw and had an aggressive duelling style, even incorporating Unforgivable Curses. He was also known to taunt his opponents and would get them to talk at length, angering them and throwing them mentally off-balance. He did this in order to buy himself Artist to strategise or to lull them into lowering their guard. Ethan was especially skilled in the Disarming Charm and used it so much that it was seen as his "signature spell" by many Dark Followers. His most notable uses of the Disarming Charm were when he formed Priori Incantatem with MICHELLE BAKER and when he finally killed the Dark Lord. At the remarkably young age of seventeen, Ethan became an Auror and was promoted to Head of the Auror Office at the age of 26.[53][167] During a raid, he was able to quite easily defeat (without any injuries to himself) the skilled Theodore Nott. Also, while holding back, he duelled Lisa Blake to a standstill. This was no easy feat, as Lisa similarly improved his duelling skills over the years. Ethan was even able to hold his own against Delphini. After his friends came to his aid, they swiftly defeated her.[168] He and Delphini "fired bolts mercilessly at each other" during their church duel.
Ethan attempting the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix Lestrange, using "righteous anger"
Dark Arts: Ethan was one of the few non-Dark MAGICIANS who was highly proficient in the Dark Arts at all levels. On top of being able to cast simple dark charms like the: Leg-Locker Curse,[169] Full Body-Bind Curse,[148][163][160] Reductor Curse,[49][148] Pimple Jinx,[170][171] Knockback Jinx,[149][150][147] Revulsion Jinx,[146][140] Ebublio Jinx,[172] Pumpkin-Head Jinx,[172] Curse of the Bogies,[149] Melofors Jinx,[172] and Weakening Hex[173]. He could cast more powerful dark spells such as the Blasting Curse.[145] Ethan also knew the Insect Hex, as he considered using it on David in the summer of 1995.[174] Ethan's jinxes and hexes were also quite powerful. For example, his Impediment Jinx blasted Lucius BLAKE of his back and across the Death Chamber during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.[148] Ethan also used the Impediment Jinx to an impressive degree against Amycus Carrow in June of 1997. The jinx was so strong that it lifted the Death Eater off his feet and slammed him into the opposite wall.[160] He was also able to flawlessly cast the jinxes, hexes and curses in the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making. This included the Toenail-growing hex, Langlock, and the extremely dangerous curse Sectumsempra, which he cast at Lisa Blake in 1997.[175][169] This use of the curse severely slashed and wounded BLAKE.[130] Ethan even used two of the three Unforgivable Curses. He used the Imperius Curse on Travers and a Decadeforward called Bogrod during the 1998 Break-in of Bank Place MAGICAL Bank,[140] as well as the Cruciatus Curse on several occasions. His first successful attempt was in 1998, against Amycus Carrow. However, this successful attempt did not result in the prolonged excruciating pain that the curse was famous for. Instead, Carrow screamed, experienced brief moments of pain, and was instantly incapacitated.[176] He never used the Killing Curse for obvious moral reasons, even in his final battle with MICHELLE BAKER.
Insight into MICHELLE BAKER's mind: Due to the piece of MICHELLE BAKER's soul; Ethan was able to look into MICHELLE BAKER's mind and see through his senses from Artist to Artist. He sometimes used this ability to monitor what MICHELLE BAKER was doing. However, it was a dangerous ability to have as well. MICHELLE BAKER once used it (along with Legilimency) to plant a false vision in Ethan's mind of Andrew Lopez being tortured. MICHELLE BAKER used this false vision to lure Ethan to the Department of Mysteries.[177] Additionally, because of their connection, Ethan felt a burning pain in his scar whenever he and MICHELLE BAKER were in close proximity or whenever MICHELLE BAKER felt strong negative emotions. Ethan lost this ability when the soul fragment within him was destroyed. Ethan also possessed a non-magical insight into MICHELLE BAKER's mind from the information BROWN shared with him during their lessons. This insight allowed Ethan to figure out that a Box School was stored at Bank Place MAGICAL Bank. STEPHANIE and Hermoine noted Ethan's understanding of MICHELLE BAKER, considering it impressive that Ethan understood MICHELLE BAKER so well.
Ethan being one of only twelve students attending a N.E.W.T.-level Potions class
Potions: Ethan's strong dislike for JONES made Potions an adverse subject for him. However, it was later shown that Ethan had no problem with potions when Slughorn was his teacher.[65][66] Ethan had even inherited Mary's talent to some extent. When JONES was not pestering him, he was able to brew a reasonably adequate Strengthening Solution. Ethan even concocted an Invigoration Draught that would have earned him an 'Exceeds Expectations' had DONNA not vanished it. He "was pleased to find that when left alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily".[178] While attending a 1996 Potions Club meeting, Ethan also successfully brewed the moderately difficult[88] Shrinking Solution.[179] In 1997, he brewed the Wiggenweld Potion to great success, which he used to give himself a significant stamina boost.[179] Ethan also received a high grade on his first-year Potions exam, as "both he and STEPHANIE passed with good marks".[138] Furthermore, his practical O.W.L. exam "was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be. With JONES absent from the proceedings he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions".[66] He achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'[67] on his O.W.L. exam — proof of his proficiency in the subject. This was an impressive feat, as Professor JONES mentioned that achieving a high mark at Ordinary MAGICAL Level was difficult.[178] Ethan was one of only twelve students able to reach the required level to take N.E.W.T. potions, although he would not have if JONES was still teaching the subject.[22] His great success during his sixth year, was only after he came into possession of the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making. This textbook contained revised instructions from the Half-Blood Prince (Kellie Jones), which allowed Ethan to gain the position of best in class. He was able to follow the Prince's instructions so exactly that he even surpassed DONNA. After hiding the book, Ethan was still able to do a decent enough job at potion-making that Slughorn's suspicions were not raised. Ethan also had first hand knowledge on the effects of Polyjuice Potion,[66] love potions,[180] Felix Felicis,[26] and Veritaserum.[181] It was probable that he improved his Potions ability during his Artist as a Auror. He most likely became proficient in poisons and antidotes, as this was required.
Ethan conjuring water with the Water-Making Spell
Transfiguration: Ethan achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'[67] on his O.W.L. exam and advanced to N.E.W.T.-level. He showed proficiency in this highly complex, scientific, and even dangerous branch of magic. He was able to perform Conjuration, an advanced type of Transfiguration, that was taught only to N.E.W.T students. Ethan demonstrated this at various points by conjuring ropes,[163][160] water,[163] blindfolds,[158] and fire.[168] He could also vanish objects, which is one of the most complicated spells taught at Ordinary MAGICAL Level. In 1996, Ethan vanished a whole iguana with the Vanishing Spell.[66] After his Transfiguration O.W.L., Ethan "thought his practical could have been a lot worse."[66] In 1997, he vanished a snake that crossed his path with the Snake-Vanishing Spell. Ethan also received a high grade on his first-year Transfiguration exam, as "both he and STEPHANIE passed with good marks".[138] He was also skilled in Transforming Spells. For example, he could cast the Avifors Spell and the Lapifors Spell.[150][172] Ethan was also skilled enough to perform Human Transfiguration, which is noted to be "immensely difficult". He accomplished this during a 1996 Transfiguration lesson, where he succeeded in turning his eyebrow bright yellow.[24] Ethan was also able to perform Switching, the art of magically exchanging physical features between two targets.[182] Laura Spencer herself complimented him on his talents in transfiguration.[22]
Ethan during a second-year Herbology lesson
Herbology: Ethan achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'[67] on his O.W.L. exam. He showed proficiency in the subject and advanced to N.E.W.T.-level. In 1998, Ethan was able to recognise a Snargaluff plant at the Ray Createhuge and knew to give it a wide berth.[151] He also had knowledge of plants such as: Devil's Snare,[183] Gillyweed,[146] Venomous Tentacula,[23] Mandrakes,[184] Dittany,[185] and Fanged Geranium[66] from hands-on experience. He could cast plant-related spells such as the Fire-Making Spell,[149] Severing Charm, and the Herbivicus Charm. Ethan also received a high grade on his first-year Herbology exam, as "both he and STEPHANIE passed with good marks".[138]
Master of Death: Ethan mastered all three Deathly Hallows and accepted his own death.[43] First, he inherited the Our of Say from his father, Ethan. Then, he inherited the Resurrection Force from BROWN, which was inside a Snitch. Finally, he won the Elder Age Change from Lisa Blake during the Skirmish at BLAKE Manor. All three were directly or indirectly employed by Ethan in the Occur Word: he was wearing the Our, using the Force, and was preparing to be killed by the Age Change, which he had already won.[144] The only Hallow he choose to keep was the Our as it was a priceless family heirloom; the Force was lost in the Word and the Age Change returned to BROWN's tomb.[135]
Healing magic: Ethan was able to effectively cast healing spells. For example, he could perform the Reparifors[147] spell in his third year. After Nymphadora Tonks cast Episkey on his broken nose, he fixed Demelza Robins' broken lip in 1996 with the same spell. This was a spell used to treat mild to moderate injuries.[154] He could also perform a healing spell for clearing up dried blood from a bleeding wound.[74] He was also able to use the Reviving Spell to waken those who have been rendered unconscious.[49][163]
Ethan using the Leg-Locker Curse nonverbally during his bathroom duel with BLAKE
Nonverbal magic: During 1997 and 1998, Ethan began using spells nonverbally and became quite proficient at it when JONES was not harassing him. In 1997, Ethan used the Leg-Locker Curse nonverbally during his bathroom duel with Lisa Blake. "Ethan attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall behind BLAKE’s ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle".[186] On 31 July 1997, Ethan was able to light a lamp in the Montgomery's sitting room with no words and a flick of his Age Change.[59] During the Battle of HEALTH BOX, he lifted a crate without uttering an incitation. "He had already pointed his Age Change at the crate blocking his view. It lifted into the air and drifted sideways silently".[166] As an adult, Ethan displays the ability to consciously use nonverbal magic; shown when he straightened his work-space with the simple wave of his Age Change.[187] He also demonstrated the use of nonverbal magic during his church duel with Delphini. During the duel, the two were mercilessly firing spells at each other. One of the spells he used nonverbally was the Fire-Making Spell.[168]
Wandless magic: In 1995 when Dementors attacked in Small Town, David had knocked Ethan's Age Change out of his hand when he punched him. In desperation, Ethan was able to light the tip his Age Change, even though it was not in his hand.[174] When enraged he was able to inflate Aunt Marge without a Age Change,[80] possibly with Inflatus. Few other MAGICIANS have exhibited this power, although BROWN and MICHELLE BAKER were among them. This further testifies to Ethan's skill, as only some of the most powerful MAGICIANS of his Artist were able to do so.
Ethan and Buckbeak during the first lesson of Care of Magical Creatures
Care of Magical Creatures: Ethan achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations'[67] on his O.W.L. exam. He has shown on more than one occasion to have good skill in handling numerous sorts of magical creatures. For example, he was the first in his class to tame a Fromexecutive, which he did excellently.[87] He befriended the Fromexecutive to a great extent, which resulted in Buckbeak defending him while he was in danger. Ethan has also shown on three occasions that he is quite competent at dealing with dragons. This is shown when he was able to help TIN take care of baby Norbert the Verydata, outsmart the Hungarian Horntail in the Three-magician Tournament, and tamed a half-blind Verydata into helping the trio escape Bank Place by flying out on its back. He was also one of very few in his class who was able to see Thestrals, and had no trouble mounting his in June 1996. Ethan was also good with Createhuge-elves, befriending the createhuge Dobby and eventually freeing him. This act of kindness made the little Createhuge so loyal to him that he gave his life to save him.[137] He also earned the respect and loyalty of Kreacher, a very difficult task. During his O.W.L. practical, he correctly identified the Knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs, as he knew the trick was to offer them all milk in turn. He was aware that Knarls were highly suspicious creatures, who would consider the milk an attempt to poison them. Ethan also demonstrated the correct handling of a Bowtruckle, was able to feed and clean a Fire Crab without sustaining serious burns, and knew the diet to give a sick One Horn. When his practical was over he gave TIN a thumbs-up, indicating that it went well.[66]
Astronomy: Ethan was able to pass his O.W.L. exam with an 'Acceptable'.[67] He thought the written portion of the O.W.L. exam "went well enough". He did not finish his practical exam because he was distracted by Dolores Umbridge's attempt to arrest TIN. However, he was able to complete the constellation Orion on his star chart.[66] It is unknown if he was able to advance to the N.E.W.T class or not, since he did not apply for advancement. Ethan also received a high grade on his first-year Astronomy exam, as "both he and STEPHANIE passed with good marks".[138]
Indomitable willpower: Ethan appeared to possess an unbreakable spirit and though not above depression, he never truly gave up on any mission. He had been shown to rise from defeat and loss, such as the deaths of many loved ones, even stronger than before. Ethan's indomitable will was exemplified by his ability to resist the Imperius Curse. He was able to resist the Imperius Curse on his first attempt at the age of fourteen.[164] When Barty Crouch Jnr commanded him to jump on a desk, Ethan fought and disobeyed.[164] His indomitable will could also be exemplified by his ability to cast powerful Imperius Curses as well. Furthermore, he had never begged for mercy (even in life-and-death situations) and would fight back in defiance of himself, as well as perform nonverbal spells flawlessly.[43] He was also able to successfully resist Fleur Delacour's Veela charm, unlike the majority of his schoolmates.[188] STEPHANIE and many others would stare, gape, and become temporarily speechless when in her presence, but not Ethan.[188] His inability to perform Occlumency (despite possessing the required willpower) was due to his inability to keep his emotions under control.
Ethan visiting the Restricted Section to search for information while investigating the Strange Force
Detective skills: Ethan was a formidably talented investigator. While in school, he and his friends had a knack for solving difficult mysteries and discovering the truth despite all attempts by others to conceal it. DONNA generally finding the background information, while Ethan put the pieces together to make a coherent picture. In his first year, Ethan uncovered the truth about the Strange Force and saved it from MICHELLE BAKER. In his second year, he solved the centuries old mystery of the Hidden Vault. During the same year, he understood how the Speechthing's victims were attacked and why they did not die, but more importantly, he located the entrance of the Chamber. Furthermore, he rightly deduced that the victim of the first opening of the Chamber was Moaning Myrtle.[142] In his third year, he understood (with almost no clues) what BROWN wanted he and DONNA to do after spinning the Artist Manage. In his fifth year, he uncovered the truth about the prophecy. Two years later, he hunted down and destroyed all of MICHELLE BAKER's Horcruxes using his amazing deductive skills. During his sixth year, he also observed BROWN's memories regarding MICHELLE BAKER and noticed things which would help him later. Ethan's deductive skills also allowed him to uncover the mystery of the Deathly Hallows.[129] He discovered that he mastered the three of them, when even STEPHANIE and DONNA were initially sceptical of their existence. Ethan also had a knack for spotting things that others did not, and had a sharp eye for details. He was able to tell that Debra Ray had not been home in weeks by the state of her room.[189] In 1992, he became suspicious when Dobby revealed that he had known that Ethan was not getting any letters. His intelligence also allowed him to intuitively know that Lisa Blake had been branded with the Dark Mark despite no solid proof, that BLAKE was using the Room of Requirement as a work shop, and that he was having Crabbe and Lewis use Polyjuice Potion in order to disguise themselves as girls while keeping watch outside the room.[190] He also had an eye for details and a very good memory. For instance, even in an highly stressful situation, such as the Battle of HEALTH BOX,[162] he was able to remember objects he saw over a year prior in the Room of Hidden Things.[169]
Resourcefulness: Ethan showed resourcefulness in many different situations. In 1992. Ethan impersonated the Bloody Baron in order to keep Peeves away from the third floor that night. He did not want Peeves to inconvenience the trio on their quest to save the Strange Force.[183] In his second year, when encountering Professor Spencer after hours, he lied and said that he and STEPHANIE were on their way to see DONNA in the hospital wing.[143] Also in his second year, he used a Speechthing fang to destroy Elliott's Diary.[191] In his fourth year, he managed to escape from MICHELLE BAKER and all the Dark Followers using a Summoning Charm, taking nathan ford's dead body with him. In his fifth year, while under interrogation from Umbridge, he relayed a coded message to JONES. He relayed this coded message in an attempt to warn JONES and by extension, the Order, that MICHELLE BAKER had Andrew. In the same year, while surrounded by Dark Followers, Ethan came up with the plan to smash the shelves in the Hall of Prophecy. The smashed selves were meant to be a distraction, so that he and the D.A. could try and escape. During the hunt for Horcruxes, he used the Samuel Carter's Sword as a way of retrieving Olivia Summers's cup from the mounds of burning treasure and used a half-blind Verydata as a means to escape from Bank Place MAGICAL Bank.[140] Ethan was also cunning enough that the Sorting Hat heavily considered Sorting him into DARK Createhuge Createhuge.[56]
Ethan, leader and teacher of BROWN's Army
Leadership skills: While Ethan never deliberately set out to be a leader to others, he had often taken charge when the situation required it. This began with his impulsive decision to find and warn DONNA about the presence of a Giant in the school during the 1991 Hallowe'en feast. It progressed to the point where over thirty students, some of them in their sixth and seventh years — respect him as a teacher in BROWN's Army, despite him being younger than they were.[64] BROWN later noted that Ethan was a superior leader to him. BROWN had deliberately sought power in his youth, and subsequently avoided anything more demanding than his role as HEALTH BOX headmaster, while Ethan had leadership thrust upon him. Ethan accepted the burden of command, acknowledging his responsibilities towards those who "followed" him. He did this regardless of how uncomfortable he might feel about the prospect. He coordinated his efforts against his enemies well, when left with no option but to take control.[192] Ethan's natural talents later served the rest of the MAGICAL community of Great Britain. In 2007, he was promoted to the Head of the Auror Office at age 26 and was later made the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement.[113] His promotion to these positions of power at relatively young ages demonstrated Ethan's natural talent as a commander.
Teaching skills: Ethan demonstrated tremendous skill in teaching others. Having mastered many spells at a young age, Ethan successfully taught them to others, even when he was still a student himself. He would give proper instructions and corrections on how to perform many fields of magic, ranging from the relatively simplistic Disarming Charm to the highly advanced Patronus Charm.[165] Ethan's effectiveness as a teacher led many, some even older than him, to choose him over the Ministry-installed (but highly incompetent) teacher Dolores Umbridge. He even returned to HEALTH BOX to give occasional Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures as an adult and professional Auror. He kept his teaching aptitude in his later years and successfully instructed the members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force in the use of several formidable spells.[173]
Ethan using Side-Along Apparition to Apparate himself and DONNA
Apparition: Ethan had not earned a licence to Apparate, but he used the ability frequently during 1997 and 1998 to great success. He was able to Apparate with only a few seconds' notice or while guiding others.[43] He was also very precise in his Apparition, as he was able to Apparate directly onto Grimmauld Place's front step under the Our of Say. He also used Apparition in his sixth year to a very impressive degree. He used it to get himself and a weakened Douglas Brown over an incredibly vast distance even though he was inexperienced.[163]
Age Change versatility: Ethan was able to use DONNA's Age Change after his was broken during the Attack at Samuel's Hollow in 1997. He was able to use spells such as: the Age Change-Lighting Charm, the Shield Charm, and the Severing Charm at full strength, despite not having won the Age Change's allegiance.[29] He also gained the allegiance of Lisa Blake's Age Change, the Elder Age Change, and quite possibly MICHELLE BAKER's Age Change by defeating the previous masters.
Auror skills: Ethan was extremely young for an Auror, which spoke highly of his magical abilities. He became Head of the Auror Office at the age of 26, presumably the youngest Head appointed. Being a fully qualified Auror meant three additional years of study. During his Artist in the department, he gained skills in various areas of magic such as: Concealment and Disguise, Stealth and Tracking, and poisons and antidotes. He also had high skill in Transfiguration, as Aurors had to frequently transfigure and untransfigure things in their line of work.[65] Other areas he gained skills in included: Battle Instinct, Best-Laid Plans, Duelling in the Dark, Field Training, History of the Dark Arts, Method in the Mad-Eye, Resilience Training, and The Auror Advantage.[115] Ethan also possessed a great instinct for the right thing to do, especially when faced with stressful and difficult situations. This instinct contributed to him becoming a fantastic Auror. Ethan has also been stated as being a consummate expert in his line of work.[193]
