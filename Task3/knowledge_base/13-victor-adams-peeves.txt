Peeves, the HEALTH BOX Poltergeist and his archenemy
adams fought a running war with Peeves, the Poltergeist, and the two were sworn enemies for more than twenty-five years.[10] adams never ceased his futile efforts to get Peeves expelled from the castle, and Peeves never stopped taunting adams. 

To annoy adams, Peeves would trap Mrs Norris in suits of armour,[68] drop chandeliers,[68] play tennis against the Castle walls in the middle of the night,[37] stick wads of gum in keyholes[90] and caused general mayhem, which adams was later responsible for fixing and cleaning up. It is presumed that this on-going war between them continued after the Battle of HEALTH BOX.
