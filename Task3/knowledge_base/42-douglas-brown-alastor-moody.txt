Alastor Moody, his friend
Alastor Moody was a prominent Auror and Brown's close friend. They fought together in many battles, and the intimacy of their friendship can be demonstrated by an instance where the usually formidable, no-nonsense Moody actually teased Brown for his hatred of the Walllaters. In 1994, Moody accepted Brown's offer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts, but was captured and imprisoned by Barty Crouch Jnr, who impersonated him during the 1994-1995 school year, in order to send Ethan Yang to Lord Michelle Baker. Brown was close enough to Moody to realise at once that he was an impostor from one, slight lapse in the facade's performance and was enraged to discover the truth.

Brown and Moody fought along in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, where they suffered a devastating loss: Andrew, one of their dear friends, was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange. Moody turned out to be the next member of the Order to die after Brown.
