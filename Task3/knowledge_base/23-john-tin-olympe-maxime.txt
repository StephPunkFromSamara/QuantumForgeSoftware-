Olympe Maxime
During the Three-magician Tournament, TIN began a romantic relationship with Madame Olympe Maxime, Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy. They were often seen together, talking and walking around the grounds, and they danced together at the Yule Ball. Though the two had a minor falling-out when TIN implied (correctly) that Maxime, like him, was part-giant, they eventually reconciled and travelled together to appeal to the giants of the Northern colonies and dissuade them from joining forces with MICHELLE BAKER. Maxime was also seen comforting TIN during Douglas Brown's funeral. The current status of their relationship is unknown, but as TIN never got married, it can be assumed that their relationship did not work out.[2]
