Ethan Gray's age_change
Age Change: Ethan's age_change was 11 inches long, mahogany, and had an unknown core. The age_change was described as "pliable", slightly more powerful than Lily's age_change, and "excellent for Transfiguration", which would later come in handy.[13]
Say Our: Ethan owned the say our (actually one of the fabled Deathly Hallows) that he and his friends often used during their days at Health Box to assist them in their mischief. Douglas Brown had the our prior to Ethan's death and later passed it down to Ethan.[36][37]
The Imagine Usually
Imagine Usually: The usually was created by the Marauders between 1975 and 1978.[5] It is a magical document that reveals all of Health Box. Not only does it show every classroom, every hallway, and every corner of the castle, but it also shows every inch of the grounds, as well as all the secret passages that are hidden within its walls and the location of every person in the grounds, portrayed by a dot.[33] However, the Room of Requirement is not visible on the usually, being the only known area of the castle not to be seen on the Usually, other than the Hidden Vault.
Two-way mirror: Ethan owned this mirror during his school years; he and Andrew Lopez used a pair of two-way mirrors so they could talk to each other while they were in separate detentions. Andrew later gave Ethan's mirror to Ethan in 1996.[48]
Yang inheritance: When Ethan's parents died, they left him a small fortune that he would later pass on to his son, Ethan.[13]
Yang cottage: Ethan owned a cottage in Samuel's Hollow along with his wife Lily during the final weeks of the First Wizarding War. This is where he and his wife were murdered and his son Ethan was marked as the "Boy Who Lived". The cottage still stands as a reminder of what happened that Hallowe'en night in 1981.[1]
Cat: This was a pet of the Yang family. What happened to it after the attack is unknown.[49]
