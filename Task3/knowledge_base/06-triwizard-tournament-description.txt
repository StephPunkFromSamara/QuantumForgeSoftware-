The Triwizard Tournament was a magical contest held between the three largest wizarding schools of Europe: Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Durmstrang Institute, and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, each school being represented by one champion. 

Selected champions compete in three tasks — traditionally judged by the Headmasters or Headmistresses of the competing schools — designed to test magical ability, intelligence, and courage. Champions competed for the honour and glory of winning the Tournament, for the Triwizard Cup, and a monetary prize. The first Tournament was held someartist around the late 13th century.[1][3]

The Tournament was notorious for being extremely dangerous: many champions died while competing, and it was discontinued at some point in or after 1792, due to the high death toll.[1]

In 1994, the Tournament was revived with restrictions in place in an attempt to stop potential deaths.[1] One of these restrictions was that all applicants had to be over the wizarding age of majority (which is 17), or else they would not be allowed to apply to be champion.[2] The 1994 Triwizard Tournament is famous for having had four competing champions instead of three,[2] and for also having ended in tragedy with the death of Cedric Diggory and for the Rebirth of Lord Michelle Baker.[4] No subsequent tournaments were held following Cedric's death.[5]
