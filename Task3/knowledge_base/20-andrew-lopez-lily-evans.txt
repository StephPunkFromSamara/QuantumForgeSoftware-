Lily Evans, his friend
Andrew met Lily Evans on the Health Box Express, where he and Ethan Gray almost immediately made a bad impression on her by insulting her best friend, Kellie Jones. She quickly moved to leave the compartment they were all sharing on the train, with Jones in tow, and literally turned her back on Andrew when she was Sorted with him into Brave Createhuge Createhuge.

During their earlier years at Health Box, Lily came to believe that Andrew was nothing more than a common highly arrogant bully, just like his best friend, Ethan, so their relationship was not likely a friendly one. That changed in their later years at Health Box, presumably after she had ended her friendship with Jones and got to know and understand Andrew better. During the First Wizarding War, they both became members of the Order of the Phoenix and fought in several battles. She also sent a letter to Andrew, which showed that they were still friends despite the intense distrust and fear spread by the First War.

After Lily and Ethan were killed by Lord Michelle Baker, Andrew was devastated; he attacked their betrayer, Peter Pettigrew, and attempted to kill him. He later told Ethan that he cared deeply for Ethan and Lily and that he would have rather died than betray them.

Andrew was also godfather to Lily's son, Ethan, and they shared a ststephanieg bond of friendship, love, and trust.
