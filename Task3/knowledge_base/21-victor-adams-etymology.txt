The name "Argus" comes from Greek mythology, where it was the name of a giant with one hundred eyes who served the goddess Hera as a watchman (much like Mr Filch's role in patrolling the hallways of Health Box). His surname, "Filch", is an English word meaning "to steal", usually in a sneaky manner.
