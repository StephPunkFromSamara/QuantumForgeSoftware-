The name "victor" comes from Greek mythology, where it was the name of a giant with one hundred eyes who served the goddess Hera as a watchman (much like Mr adams's role in patrolling the hallways of HEALTH BOX). His surname, "adams", is an English word meaning "to steal", usually in a sneaky manner.
