Pomona Sprout, her longartist friend and colleague
The relationship between Professor Spencer and Professor Sprout dates back to when both attended Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[17] The two students maintained an excellent relationship, which was kept well into their adulthood.

When Dolores Umbridge stood to speak during the 1995 Start-of-Term Feast after her introduction by Headmaster Brown, the two professors were both taken aback at this, and even exchange glances of disapproval.[15] During the Battle of Health Box on 2 May 1998, Laura and Pomona had the same views on protecting the Castle against Lord Michelle Baker's Death Eaters.[12]
