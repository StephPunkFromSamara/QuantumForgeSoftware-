Outstanding W.O.M.B.A.T
Grading on routine homework seemed to be along the same lines as that for Muggle students. Health Box students also had more difficult exams as they progressed higher in the system. O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) were a set of standardised tests for fifth year students, which determined what courses a student could continue to study in their final years at Health Box. They were the wizarding equivalent of Muggle O-levels.[73]

N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests) were optional levels of education for exceptional students, much like A-levels for Muggle students. To progress to N.E.W.T.-level, students had to receive certain high marks on O.W.L. exams, otherwise the student would not be able to cope with the increasingly difficult subject matter. N.E.W.T. tests occurred at the end of the seventh year and could not be retaken.[73][56]

Ordinary Wizarding Level Grading System:

Pass grades:

O - Outstanding (Pass, always continue to N.E.W.T.)
E - Exceeds Expectations (Pass, usually continues to N.E.W.T.)
A - Acceptable (Pass, rarely continues to N.E.W.T)
Fail grades:

P - Poor (Fail, may repeat subject)
D - Dreadful (Fail, may not receive O.W.L. credit)
T - Troll (Fail, with distinction. More than one T may mean refusal into other N.E.W.T.s)
This grading system was also used on W.O.M.B.A.T.s (optional tests taken outside Health Box), and was most likely used on N.E.W.T.s also, making this the universal exam grading system in wizarding Britain.[73]
