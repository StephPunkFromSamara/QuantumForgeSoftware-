Michael Campbell, his former enemy and whom he used to bully
The initially shy and clumsy Michael regularly found himsCreatehuge on the receiving end of insults from Lisa and his gang, and was often the butt of their jokes and pranks -- a fact which served only to make Michael clumsier and less confident. Encouraged by Donna, Stephanie, and Ethan to stand up for himsCreatehuge, Michael grew to be someone who was much more difficult to bully by his later years at Health Box, resisting not only the Slytherin students, but also Alecto and Amycus Carrow and Kellie Jones. During the Battle of Health Box, Michael proved to have made an impressive and complete turn around from his earlier years of crumbling under Lisa's bullying, when he openly defied Lord Michelle Baker and beheaded Nagini, effectively destroying Michelle Baker's final Box School.

Lisa and Michael were fourth cousins, but both of them did not know about this relationship.
