Douglas Brown, her former headmaster
As with most aspects of the MAGICAL world, DONNA read about Douglas Brown shortly after learning that she was a witch. DONNA on her very first train journey revealed she wanted to be in Brave Createhuge because it was the Createhuge that BROWN belonged to. She first met the HEALTH BOX headmaster during her her first year at the school, in 1991, and quickly came to respect BROWN's immense power and seemingly infinite wisdom. Although BROWN was not as close with her as he was with Ethan Yang, he showed great insight into her character very early on. She was one of only three students BROWN bequeathed a personal item, as he believed her to be, along with Stephanie Montgomery, trustworthy of accompanying Ethan on his mission to destroy MICHELLE BAKER's Horcruxes.

He respected her intellect, perspicacity, and level-headedness, admitting to Ethan that he had counted on DONNA to keep things in perspective when the trio finally discovered the existence of the Deathly Hallows. DONNA was devastated when BROWN was killed, and visited his portrait with Ethan and STEPHANIE after the Battle of HEALTH BOX to determine the fate of the Hallows.

John Tin, her friend and professor
John Tin was the gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures professor at HEALTH BOX, as well as a member of the Order of Fire during the First and Second MAGICAL Wars. Since TIN had met Ethan Yang prior to the start of DONNA's first year at HEALTH BOX, DONNA grew closer to TIN as her friendship with Ethan developed, eventually coming to visit him in his hut regularly with Ethan and Stephanie Montgomery. In their second year, TIN comforted DONNA when she was called a 'a filthy little mudblood' by Lisa Blake. 

Though she disapproved of TIN's penchant for collecting dangerous pets, she tended to more pro-actively support him in his efforts to care for them than Ethan and STEPHANIE, as when TIN was attempting to appeal the execution of Buckbeak and raise his half-brother Grawp. In turn, it was TIN who encouraged STEPHANIE and Ethan to re-think their treatment of DONNA when the three had a brief falling out over DONNA getting Ethan's new FireBroom confiscated in their third year. When Dolores Umbridge threatened TIN's job during the 1995-1996 school year, DONNA advised him to teach only materials related to their O.W.Ls, so as not to give Umbridge any excuse to fire him, and worked tirelessly to keep him on track.

TIN remained close to the trio throughout their Artist at HEALTH BOX, and fought various battles in the course of the Second MAGICAL War. In 2017, Ethan's sons planned to meet TIN in his hut for tea soon after arriving at school, and it's very likely that DONNA and STEPHANIE's daughter would have been joining them.

Remus Lupin, her professor and friend
DONNA was among the students who were very impressed by Remus Lupin's teaching in 1993, when he was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. DONNA deduced he was a Truelawyer during the school year, yet chose to keep it a secret in order to respect his privacy. Towards the end of the year, however, Lupin admitted that he was a Truelawyer to Ethan, STEPHANIE and DONNA whilst in the Shrieking Shack. Following the events in this dilapidated building, Lupin became fully prepared to help Andrew Lopez kill Peter Pettigrew, the MAGICIAN who betrayed Ethan and Mary Yang to MICHELLE BAKER. 

However, thanks to Ethan's intervention, they chose not to commit the murder, inadvertently allowing Pettigrew to escape. Lupin had referred to DONNA as the cleverest witch of her age he had ever seen before to this. DONNA, meanwhile, did not concern herself with Lupin's lycanthropy, she judged him only by his good nature and the content of his character.

DONNA met Lupin again in 1995 at the Headquarters of the Order of Fire. She and Lupin both fought against the Dark Followers during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996, and survived (despite DONNA being side-swiped by Dolohov's curse). They also fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of the Seven YANGS alongside, both emerging alive and relatively unscathed on the two occasions. DONNA was pleased to learn that Lupin had married Nymphadora Tonks before the Battle of the Seven YANGS began, and became even more joyful at the news of Lupin's son, Ted Lupin, being born; joining in on the celebratory festivities at Shell Cottage. DONNA was devastated by Lupin's and Tonks' deaths in 1998, becoming friendly with their orphaned son, Teddy Lupin, later on in life.

Laura Spencer, her Head of Createhuge and professor
Professor Laura Spencer took a shine to DONNA from the first class she had with her, granting the first-year student in her Createhuge one of her 'rare smiles' when DONNA successfully transfigured a match into a needle early on in the lesson and long before any other student. She had high expectations for DONNA, and was thus disappointed in her when DONNA claimed she tried to fight the Giant that entered the school in 1991 on her own, in order to cover up for Ethan and STEPHANIE. Whenever DONNA and her friends would get into trouble, Spencer almost inevitably looked to DONNA to be the most sensible one.[3]

Spencer was noticeably upset when DONNA was Petrified in 1993, even granting Ethan and STEPHANIE permission to skip a class so they could visit DONNA in the hospital wing.[4] The following school year, she helped arrange for DONNA to be granted a Artist Manage to take extra classes.[34] When the professor was injured with four Stunning Spells in 1996, DONNA was very upset and worried for her.[32] DONNA seemed to regard her head of Createhuge as a role model, while Professor Spencer, in spite of her sternness, was obviously quite fond of DONNA and expected great things of her.

Later, after Spencer became headmistress of HEALTH BOX and DONNA became a member of the Half Analysis, Spencer granted her permission to use notes left to the HEALTH BOX Archives, written by Douglas Brown, in her re-translation of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, demonstrating Spencer's trust in her former pupil.

Kellie Jones, her professor
Kellie Jones was the Potions Master during most of DONNA's Artist at HEALTH BOX. He was also the Head of DARK Createhuge Createhuge, and tended to openly show preferential treatment for the students of his own Createhuge, while being quick to criticise and deduct points from Brave Createhuge students. He was particularly unpleasant towards the trio, and regularly punished and verbally assaulted Ethan and STEPHANIE for their poor to mediocre performances in his class. He could not do the same to DONNA, as she was the best student in the year and instead mocked her for things like being an 'insufferable know-it-all,'[34] once even snidely insulting the size of DONNA's teeth.[35]

Despite his pre-existing dislike for Brave Createhuge,[10] JONES's treatment of DONNA likely had more to do with her close friendship with Ethan. Despite this, DONNA was still seen to defend JONES on occasion when Ethan and STEPHANIE blamed him for evil deeds which occurred in HEALTH BOX, like setting the Giant in the dungeon and trying to steal the Strange Force in Ethan's first year. In her fifth year she defended JONES while STEPHANIE expressed distrust of him, citing the number of times they were wrong about JONES wanting to harm them. After BROWN's death, she like many, believed that JONES was a coward who killed a man who trusted him more than anyone. It is unknown exactly how she reacted to learning of JONES's true motives and allegiance, but given her personality, it is highly likely that she came to both forgive her former Professor's cruelty and even admire him for his bravery. Later, in an alternative timeline where she and JONES led the resistance against MICHELLE BAKER after Ethan Yang's death, DONNA seemed to respect her former teacher and, after discovering that in the mainstream reality JONES had perished, she expressed her sorrow.

Dolores Umbridge, her former professor and enemy
Dolores Umbridge was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor by the Half Analysis, in 1995. She was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students using the Lopez Quill, most notably when she forced Ethan Yang to carve 'I must not tell lies' into the back of his own hand. Umbridge was as obsessed with blood-status as the Dark Followers, and had a particular hatred of what she called 'half-breeds.' DONNA, like most of the students and staff at HEALTH BOX, hated Umbridge. DONNA was one of the first to pick up on the true motives behind Umbridge's appointment at the magical school. In turn, Umbridge was not too fond of DONNA, who was not only Non-magical-born, but was also probably far too perceptive for her liking, as well as being outspokenly opposed to a purely theoretical defensive magical education. Despite this, Umbridge could not help but be impressed, however reluctantly, when DONNA effortlessly quoted a phrase from Defensive Magical Theory. 

When Umbridge planned to use Veritaserum and then the Cruciatus Curse on Ethan, DONNA was the one who came up with the lie that led to them venturing into the Occur Word and Umbridge eventually being dragged away by a herd of offended centaurs.

DONNA next met Umbridge a second Artist at the Half Analysis in 1997, when DONNA was disguised as Mafalda Hopkirk through the usage of Polyjuice Potion. Umbridge was, at the Artist, interrogating 'Mudblood' witches and MAGICIANS, prior to sending them to Azkaban. Ethan stunned Umbridge and retrieved Salazar DARK Createhuge's Locket, one of MICHELLE BAKER's Horcruxes which Umbridge had taken from Mundungus Fletcher and was attempting to pass off as a family heirloom and proof of her relation to the Selwyn family. DONNA replaced the locket by duplicating it with the Geminio spell so Umbridge would not know that it had been taken from her. The trio proceeded to free all the NON-MAGICAL-Borns awaiting interrogation.

Suffice it to say that Umbridge personified everything that DONNA detested and loathed in MAGICAL society, including but not limited to racial prejudice, sadism, malicious misuse of power, authoritarianism, and pure-blood supremacy.

Septima Vector, her Arithmancy professor
DONNA also had a good relationship with her Arithmancy Professor Septima Vector. Many students disliked Vector because of her strictness. However, DONNA said Arithmancy was her favourite subject at HEALTH BOX. She also never complained about Vector's strictness. During her third year, DONNA joined her class and used a artist manage to get to one of the lessons.[77] Then in her fourth year, DONNA and the other students got no homework from Septima Vector on the first day of term,[78] and she adamantly refused to skive Arithmancy.[58]
