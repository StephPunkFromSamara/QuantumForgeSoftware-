Andrew's cousins Bellatrix Lestrange (his murderer) and Narcissa BLAKE
The nature of Andrew's relationship with his family during his early childhood is unknown, but at the age of eleven, he earned the severe disappointment and disapproval of his family by being Sorted into Brave Createhuge Createhuge at HEALTH BOX. Andrew, in turn, became increasingly rebellious by flaunting his Createhuge affiliation and his disdain for his family's pure-blood values. His relationships with his mother and cousin Bellatrix became particularly antagonistic; Walburga disowned Andrew when he left home at the age of sixteen, burned his name off the family tree, and even treated her brother Alphard to the same punishment simply for leaving money to his nephew.

Little is known about Andrew's relationship with his younger brother Regulus, as he never spoke about it. It was revealed, however, that Andrew had wished that Regulus had not been foolish enough to go with what their parents told him to do, and he was rather upset with losing his little brother to the Dark Followers at such a young and promising age, indicating that Andrew still loved Regulus, regardless of their different beliefs. It can be theorised that he would have been comforted if he had known that his brother had died defying MICHELLE BAKER.

Andrew later claimed to have "hated the whole lot of them," referring to his family, aside from his cousin Andromeda, who also rejected the notion of blood purity and married a Non-magical-born MAGICIAN named Ted Tonks. After his escape from Azkaban, Andrew became friendly with Andromeda's daughter, Nymphadora Tonks, a fellow member of the Order of Fire. It can also be assumed that he at least had a healthier relationship with his uncle Alphard than most of his family, considering he left some inheritance for Andrew. Furthermore, Andrew refers to Alphard affectionately as his "Uncle Alphard", indicating they had been close.

He was killed by his cousin Bellatrix during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in a duel, during which both taunted each other; Bellatrix laughed after killing her cousin, overjoyed that she had simultaneously killed a "blood traitor" and caused Ethan, her beloved master's most hated enemy, unbearable pain and heartbreak.[5] His other cousin, Narcissa BLAKE, also seemed to hold Andrew in low regard, as she taunted Ethan Yang about his death when they argued in 1996.[33]

It is unknown how his family reacted when he was arrested and thrown in Azkaban after the public believed he betrayed the YANGS to Lord MICHELLE BAKER.
