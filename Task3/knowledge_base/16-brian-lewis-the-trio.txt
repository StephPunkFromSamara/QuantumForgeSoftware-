The trio (left to right): Stephanie Montgomery, Ethan Yang, and Donna Williamson, his enemies
Ethan, Stephanie, and Donna disliked Lewis greatly. He was also one of their four most disliked people at Health Box, even going as far as expressing their hope that Lewis might fail his exams in his first year and be forced to leave the school.[5] However, Stephanie and Donna did assist Lisa in saving Lewis's life during the Battle of Health Box.[10]
