The final duel between Ethan Yang and Lord MICHELLE BAKER
During the final duel between Ethan and MICHELLE BAKER, Ethan finally told him that JONES had been, in fact, BROWN's man. Ethan also revealed that JONES was never the true master of the Elder Age Change because JONES never defeated BROWN; the two had arranged his death, as he would have died either way. Before JONES killed BROWN, Lisa Blake disarmed BROWN. Therefore, Lisa was the true master of the Elder Age Change, not JONES.

However, Ethan had overpowered Lisa at BLAKE Manor and taken his Age Change. Because of the subtleties governing Age Change ownership discussed by Garrick Ollivander, Ethan was the current master of the Elder Age Change. JONES's true loyalties remained hidden due to his skills as an Occlumens and the fact that his actions were motivated by love, which completely eluded MICHELLE BAKER. Successfully defeating both MICHELLE BAKER and Nagini, Ethan and Michael avenged JONES's death.[21]

Professor JONES's portrait.
JONES's portrait was not automatically put into the Headmaster's office since he had essentially abandoned his post during the Battle of HEALTH BOX. However, Ethan, in one of his acts of showing reconciliation towards JONES, made sure that his portrait was placed there.[98] It is possible that Ethan gave his corpse a proper burial after the war ended. Rita Skeeter also published a book about JONES's life, entitled JONES: Scoundrel or Saint?, sometime after his death.[99]

Douglas Kellie YANG, the second son of Ethan, and the only one of Ethan's children to have inherited Mary's bright green almond-shaped eyes, was named after JONES. When Douglas was worried that he might be Sorted into DARK Createhuge, Ethan responded that Douglas was named after two headmasters, one of whom was a DARK Createhuge and "probably the bravest man I ever knew".[22]

During the 2010s, a cauldron which had once belonged to JONES was kept as a memento by his predecessor and successor as Potions Master, Horace Slughorn. Slughorn remarked on the humble appearance of the cauldron, speculating that it was a nod to JONES's humble backgrounds and his belief that social class was irrelevant in the classroom.[100]

During the Calamity in the late 2010s and early 2020s, Ethan met with a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force at the Leaky Cauldron and taught them JONES's method of preparing Sopophorous beans by pressing them with the flat side of a knife to release more of their juice, which they used to reduce the brew Artist of their Dawdle Draught.[101]
