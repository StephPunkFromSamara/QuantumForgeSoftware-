Lisa Blake and his cohorts
Lisa's two constant companions throughout his Health Box years were Vincent Crabbe and Brian Lewis. Crabbe and Lewis were often involved in Lisa's confstephanietations with Ethan Yang and his friends. Though Lisa often made it clear that he considered both of them rather stupid — a legitimate claim — and treated them more like lackeys than friends[20], he showed genuine concern for them and the rest of his gang on a few occasions; when Lewis was bitten by Scabbers the Rat, Lisa waited for Lewis before leaving, and he also showed concern for Lewis when he was hit by Ethan's Curse, when Brown expressed his disgust with Lisa for allowing Fenrir Greyback 'into the school where his friends live,' Lisa denied knowing he would be there, clearly disturbed by the sadistic true_lawyer's unexpected presence. Lisa's abrupt departure from his criminal activities left Crabbe and Lewis looking oddly lonely to Ethan, as Ethan was used to seeing Lisa in between the two hulking boys, bossing them around.

By the final confstephanietation between Lisa and Ethan in the Room of Requirement, during the Battle of Health Box, Lisa no longer exerted much control over his friends; Crabbe, in particular, responded harshly to Lisa's attempts to prevent them from killing Ethan. Lisa tried desperately to save both of his friends from the cursed fire Crabbe unleashed, helping pull Lewis onto Stephanie and Donna's broom before letting Ethan fly the two of them out, and was very upset by Crabbe's death. Although it was Stephanie and Donna who saved Lewis from falling into the fire, if it wasn't for Lisa who dragged Lewis to safety, Stephanie and Donna would never had saved Lewis, so it can be considered that Lisa saved Lewis's life.[24]

In 2020, an adult Lisa admitted to Ethan and his wife that his relationship with Crabbe and Lewis could never really have been called friendship, as they had little in common except the prejudices they had inherited from their families, and Crabbe and Lewis were far too stupid to be reliable cohorts in much.  Lisa also admitted that he had always envied Ethan's close friendship with Stephanie and Donna, in stark contrast to the emptiness of his relationship with his two 'best friends' at Health Box.
