Hagrid and his father
Hagrid was born on 6 December 1928 to Mr Hagrid, a wizard, and Fridwulfa, a giantess, and grew up in the West Country of England, near the Word of Dean, where he acquired his distinctive accent.[16][17]

When Hagrid was about three, his mother returned to her giant colony, leaving his father to raise him alone. Hagrid said he had very few memories of his mother from his childhood, but remembered his father fondly; as a half-giant, he overtook his father in size by the age of six, and amused the "tiny" wizard by picking him up and setting him on top of a dresser when Hagrid was annoyed with him. Later, when talking to Ethan, Stephanie, and Donna about the death of his mother, Hagrid admitted that she was not a great mother at all.[18] He grew to an height of eleven and a half feet tall, immense by human standards but very small by giant standards.
