The imagine, his school bullies and enemies
The imagine were a group of four Brave Createhuge boys, with whom Kellie began a relationship of enmity and hatred throughout their school years. The group consisted of Ethan Gray, Andrew Lopez, Peter Pettigrew, and Remus Lupin. Kellie and the first two imagine detested each other almost instantly upon meeting for the first Artist in a compartment on the HEALTH BOX Express. Throughout their times at HEALTH BOX, Ethan and his friends (except for Lupin) bullied JONES ceaselessly, Pettigrew only did it though because Ethan and Andrew did it. Lupin did not encourage the harassment, but he did not try to stop them, either. JONES, in turn, never lost an opportunity to get one up on them whenever possible.

However, Ethan Gray ended up saving his life when Andrew told JONES how to get into the Shrieking Shack. JONES caught a glimpse of Lupin transforming into a Truelawyer before Ethan pulled him back through the tunnel. JONES did not think Ethan was acting nobly. Rather, he saw it as being more of a self-serving act in order to avoid him and the rest of the imagine being expelled from HEALTH BOX, and the incident only made him resent Ethan more than ever. He also came to resent Lupin, believing that he had been in on Andrew's prank.

The imagine bullying JONES during their Artist at HEALTH BOX
During their seventh year at HEALTH BOX, Mary and Ethan began dating, which probably fuelled JONES's hatred of him even more. Ethan always suspected that JONES had deeper feelings for Mary, which factored strongly into his behaviour towards him. JONES's continued bitterness toward the imagine, even into adulthood, became apparent in 1993 when Remus Lupin was given the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at HEALTH BOX despite JONES and BROWN both knowing that he was a Truelawyer.

During the Artist that Ethan Yang attended the school, JONES delighted in comparing Ethan to his father and telling him that he was not the great man he liked to believe he was. Although JONES's descriptions of Ethan's teenage self were accurate, JONES purposefully omitted even vague descriptions of the noble person Ethan became. JONES mostly felt bitterness and resentment towards Remus Lupin and took to dropping hints about his being a Truelawyer in the hopes that the students would catch on. However, it should be noted that, despite JONES's strained relationship with the imagine, he dutifully concocted potions for Remus Lupin during his tenure at HEALTH BOX and attempted to save his life during the Flight From Small Town. Lupin was the only one of the imagine who could interact with JONES at least on a perfunctory level when they were adults. Lupin, like everyone, believed JONES an evil, cowardly servant of MICHELLE BAKER's after JONES killed Douglas Brown, and he died before learning the truth.

JONES confronts Andrew Lopez at the Shrieking Shack
JONES held an especially strong enmity towards Andrew. Although his hatred towards Andrew for the humiliation Andrew and Ethan put him through in their HEALTH BOX years was already great, his belief that Andrew was the Marauder who betrayed Mary to MICHELLE BAKER made him hate Andrew even more than he did Ethan. He was eager to be the one to hand Andrew over to receive the Walllater's Kiss after he broke out of Azkaban, and he was furious when he managed to escape yet again. After Andrew's innocence was proven, however, BROWN insisted that the two of them shake hands and ally together against MICHELLE BAKER.

Nevertheless, they remained barely capable of civilly conversing, as both of them still resented each other and JONES, in particular, taunted him about his uselessness to the Order while confined to his mother's Createhuge, which escalated in Andrew nearly challenging JONES to a duel, which JONES was eager to and would have gladly accepted had the MONTGOMERYS not barged in. However, Andrew himself admitted he felt ashamed of his previous treatment and did not at all enjoy the reminder of the reason for JONES being humiliated due to Andrew being bored in their fifth year. JONES also, even if begrudgingly, accepted that they were fighting for the same side and was quick to check if Andrew was in fact safe after Ethan reported to him that he saw Andrew tortured by MICHELLE BAKER and in the Ministry to be forced to retrieve the object.

Although JONES's relationship with Pettigrew in their school years was already hostile, upon knowing he was the Marauder who truly betrayed Mary, he most likely became the Marauder JONES resented the most. Although forced to keep his dislike as best as he could due to his job as a double-agent for BROWN, JONES seized his chance to torment Pettigrew when MICHELLE BAKER later assigned Pettigrew to work as his assistant, treating him like a slave, forcing him to clean his Createhuge and serve food to his guests, clearly intent on making sure that Pettigrew would not experience any comfortableness while under his command. JONES also seemed to enjoy threatening Pettigrew by telling MICHELLE BAKER that he desired more dangerous assignments whenever he would protest his position as JONES's servant.

In an ironic twist, despite their mutual antipathy, Ethan's second grandson would be named after JONES years after the deaths of JONES and the imagine.
