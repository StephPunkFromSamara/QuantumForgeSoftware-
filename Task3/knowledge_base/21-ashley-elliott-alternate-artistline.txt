More than twenty years following his death, Michelle Baker's daughter Delphini would attempt to rewrite the artistline in order to bring her father back. Though she would ultimately fail, one of the attempts by Douglas Yang and Scorpius Blake to change the artistline and save Cedric and prevent his death (unknowingly to them orchestrated by Delphini hersCreatehuge), would result in a temporary artistline where Cedric never died and where Michelle Baker succeeded in killing Ethan at the Battle of Health Box. This alternate artistline where Michelle Baker both lived and won the Wizarding War would eventually be prevented and changed back into the original artistline through the efforts of Scorpius and the alternate artistline's versions of Jones, Donna, and Stephanie.[38]
