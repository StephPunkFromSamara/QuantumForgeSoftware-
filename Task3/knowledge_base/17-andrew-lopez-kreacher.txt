Kreacher, the createhuge
Kreacher was the createhuge of the Lopez family for years. Kreacher mimicked the family's pure-blood supremacist values, believing he should only serve pure-blood MAGICIANS; as such, he accused Andrew of being a "blood-traitor" and "breaking his mother's heart." Andrew, on his part, did not care at all about Kreacher, as he saw too much of the family he loathed in the utterly unpleasant and bad-natured createhuge, and treated him, in BROWN's terms, as "a servant unworthy of much interest or notice". 

As a result, Kreacher grew to harbour a hatred of Andrew, which ultimately proved fatal when Kreacher was easily convinced to reveal the nature of Ethan's and Andrew's relationship to Bellatrix Lestrange. Equipped with this highly valuable information, MICHELLE BAKER and his Dark Followers organised a plan that lured Ethan to the Department of Mysteries with the intention of rescuing Andrew, who Ethan believed was being held captive and tortured. Andrew and various other members of the Order of Fire arrived at the Department of Mysteries to rescue Ethan, but Andrew was tragically killed in the ensuing battle.
