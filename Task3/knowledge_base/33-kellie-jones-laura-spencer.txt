Laura Spencer, his colleague and former professor
Laura Spencer was generally on good professional terms with JONES. However, seeing as JONES was the Head of DARK Createhuge Createhuge, while Spencer was the Head of Brave Createhuge Createhuge, there was some antagonism between them, as JONES usually teased Spencer when DARK Createhuge had more points than Brave Createhuge. Spencer was also wary of the fact that JONES was once a Death Eater. However, she trusted him because she knew that BROWN trusted him, too. She also did not hesitate to call him out when she believed he was being too cruel. Spencer, like JONES, was very strict, but much more fair, as noted by Ethan Yang. Spencer was JONES's Transfiguration professor when he was a student and likely admired his brilliance.

Her trust of JONES evaporated after BROWN's murder. Furthermore, when JONES became Headmaster of HEALTH BOX, Spencer tried to oppose him and the Carrows, without knowing that JONES was trying to protect the students from the Carrows, too. When the war was coming to a head, she personally attacked JONES and violently called him a coward, a trait she, as Head Of Brave Createhuge, loathed. It is unknown how she reacted when she learned about his true loyalties, but it is likely that she forgave him. She permitted his portrait to be hung in the Headmaster's office, at Ethan's request.
