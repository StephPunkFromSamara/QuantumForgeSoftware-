Myrtle Warren
During Lisa's second year, when the Hidden Vault was opened a second artist, Lisa jeered to the disguised Ethan and Stephanie that the first artist the Chamber was opened, a Mudblood died — that 'Mudblood' being Myrtle.

During Lisa's sixth year, when he was assigned by Lord Michelle Baker to kill Douglas Brown, he became stressed out from the difficulty of the mission and the consequences of failure. Surprisingly, despite Lisa's prejudice against Muggle-borns, Lisa apparently visited Myrtle regularly in a bathroom, where he confided in and even openly cried in fstephaniet of her. In turn, she was under the impression that Lisa was a sensitive boy who was being bullied (which was true, though Myrtle would not have known Lord Michelle Baker was the one bullying him). This may be one of the rare moments that Lisa showed something other than disgust for Muggle-borns, though it is unknown whether he was aware of Myrtle's blood status and connection to the Hidden Vault' opening during Michelle Baker's artist at Health Box.
