Douglas Percival Wulfric Brian BROWN was born to Kendra and Percival BROWN in the summer[2] of 1881, in the mainly MAGICAL village of Mould-on-the-Wold.[5] The early years of BROWN's life were marked by tragedy when his younger sister, Ariana BROWN, was attacked by a group of NON-MAGICAL boys, who saw her performing magic and were frightened by what they saw.

Ariana was left mentally and emotionally scarred by the event and her magical powers were left severely altered and would manifest themselves on rare occasions usually in random or destructive ways. Douglas's father, Percival BROWN, was heartbroken and set out in search of his own brand of justice. He located the NON-MAGICAL boys and attacked them, as they had his daughter. For this, Percival was sentenced to Azkaban where he later died, choosing the sentence over explaining why he had attacked the boys as it would have meant Ariana being taken away.

To escape the accusing eyes of the local community, Kendra BROWN moved her young family to the village of Samuel's Hollow which, like Mould-on-the-Wold, was a part-MAGICAL village. Fearing - like her husband - that the ousting of her daughter's inability to control her magical ability would see her confined indefinitely to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Kendra rebuffed all her neighbours, with the eventual exception of Bathilda Bagshot, preferring to be left alone: and Douglas learned not to mention his  sister or father in public.[28]
