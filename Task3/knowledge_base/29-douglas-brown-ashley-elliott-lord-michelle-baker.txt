MICHELLE BAKER, his former student and greatest enemy
BROWN personally approached Mrs Cole, the caretaker of the orphanage in which Ashley Elliott resided to enrol the latter in HEALTH BOX. BROWN met Ashley Elliott for the first Artist there and was unaware at the Artist that he had just met the person who would become the most powerful and dangerous Dark MAGICIAN of all Artist. He was however intrigued by Ashley Elliott as his powers were surprisingly well-developed by such a young MAGICIAN who had begun to use them consciously. BROWN was also disturbed by the fact that Ashley was a Parselmouth, a rare ability supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although not as much as the fact that Ashley had obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy and domination which was proved by the fact that Ashley had used his magic to hurt the other children in the orphanage. BROWN then returned to HEALTH BOX intending to keep an eye upon Ashley Elliott, as he was alone and friendless, a dangerous situation, but at that point BROWN, ever the man who staunchly believed in second chances and redemption, still considered Elliott as being not a lost cause and could repent.

When then-headmaster Armando Dippet confided in BROWN about Ashley Elliott approaching him about staying on after graduation to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts — which he only refused due to Ashley's age, suggesting he ask again in a few years — BROWN advised him against it. Though he explained none of his reasons to Professor Dippet, for the headmaster was just as charmed by Ashley as the other professors, BROWN felt uneasy about the request and did not want Elliott back at HEALTH BOX in a position of power and influence over impressionable young minds.

Ashley Elliott and BROWN
While BROWN was aware of Ashley Elliott's transformation and rise to power, he still maintained contact with the latter, even allowing him to visit the school for a supposed job interview. When Ashley, or Lord MICHELLE BAKER as he began calling himself, visited the school, BROWN was courteous. However, BROWN suspected that MICHELLE BAKER wanted more than a job, likely wanting to raise an army. He was troubled at some of the rumours about Ashley, these were true of course. When BROWN turned down MICHELLE BAKER's request, this sealed the deep resentment MICHELLE BAKER would continue to feel towards him and he cursed the Defence Against the Dark Arts post out of spite.

It was clear that while many who followed BROWN's cause both feared and despised MICHELLE BAKER greatly, BROWN did not share such views as he had known Ashley Elliott personally, and although he was committed to defeating him, BROWN held no personal resentment nor fear towards the Dark Lord and continued to see him as his former student worthy of being pitied for his childhood and complete inability to understand love, as he had never received any. He even appeared to feel some deep-rooted guilt and remorse over his inability to change Elliott, as he noted with great sadness in his face and tone that he sincerely wished he could have forced MICHELLE BAKER to repent for his sins in a peaceful manner. BROWN understood the evil in Elliott as a result of a string of unfortunate events and performed intensive research on him, eventually discovering his Horcruxes. After Elliott's transformation into Lord MICHELLE BAKER, contrary to the rest of the MAGICAL community's fear of saying the Dark Lord's name, BROWN, as the only person MICHELLE BAKER (secretly) feared, refused to be intimidated by the Dark Lord, referring to him as "MICHELLE BAKER" to others and as "Ashley" in conversation with MICHELLE BAKER himself, a subtle but steadfast refusal to allow Lord MICHELLE BAKER to dictate the terms of their relationship and a trait that would later be inherited by Ethan Yang. Elliott, for his part, held BROWN in open contempt, hatred and disdain as "a NON-MAGICAL-loving fool" and believer in the power of love but nevertheless feared him and never actively sought a battle with him even with the protection of his Horcruxes, showing that he acknowledged (on an inner level) BROWN as a powerful and deadly MAGICIAN.

Douglas Brown locked in combat with MICHELLE BAKER
In 1996, BROWN and MICHELLE BAKER met face to face in the Half Analysis. MICHELLE BAKER started a dangerous duel during which he used all of his tremendous magical capabilities in an attempt to murder Ethan Yang along with his former teacher. Fortunately for BROWN, he proved himself to be worthy of his title as the only MAGICIAN who was ever feared by MICHELLE BAKER and maintained the offensive in the battle, eventually forcing MICHELLE BAKER to flee. A short while later, BROWN became aware of MICHELLE BAKER's plan to use Lisa Blake to kill him, possibly as MICHELLE BAKER realised from their previous altercation that he would lose a duel with BROWN head on and thus used BROWN's empathy for Lisa to give Lisa a greater chance to kill him. BROWN requested to JONES that he should be the one to kill him instead of BLAKE. Despite dying to JONES in 1997, BROWN's legacy allowed Ethan Yang to defeat MICHELLE BAKER once and for all in 1998.
