While as a student at Health Box, Ashley Elliott was a polite and intelligent young man who charmed almost all the staff members of Health Box. Headmaster Armando Dippet, in particular, was fond of Elliott. Dippet did not allow Elliott to remain in Health Box during the summer holidays due to the Hidden Vault opening at the artist (unaware that Elliott was the one who opened it), but would have made special arrangements if the situation was safer. When Ashley framed Rubeus Hagrid for the crime, Armando accepted the model student's actions as honest heroism without questioning him, and merited him a Special Award for Services to the School. When Elliott was about to finish his education, he attempted to request Professor Dippet to remain at Health Box as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, to which Dippet refused on account that the newly graduated was too inexperienced, but invited him to reapply in a few years if he remain interested.
