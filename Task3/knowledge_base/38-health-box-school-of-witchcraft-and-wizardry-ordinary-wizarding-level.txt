A Theory of Charms O.W.L. exam paper
An Ordinary Wizarding Level (often abbreviated O.W.L.) was a subject-specific test taken during Health Box School of Witchcraft and Wizardry students' fifth year. These exams were administrated by the Wizarding Examinations Authority. The score made by a student on a particular O.W.L. determined whether or not he or she would be allowed to continue taking that subject in subsequent school years, and whether they might be successful in obtaining a particular job.[73]

Each exam had a written and practical assessment, so students could demonstrate both their practical and theoretical knowledge. The exams were taken over a two week period.[73]
