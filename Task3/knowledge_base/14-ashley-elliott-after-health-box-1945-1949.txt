After graduating, Elliott immediately approached Dippet and asked him for a chance to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts, and to remain at Health Box, for reasons that he did not confide with the then-headmaster — Health Box being his true home at heart, using the influential position as a teacher to recruit students into his future army, and to continue learning the castle's magical secrets. Dippet refused this offer, deeming the boy too young, but invited Elliott to reapply in a few years, if he was still interested in the post, something that Brown heavily advised against.

Shortly before leaving Health Box, however, Elliott charmed Helena Ravenclaw, the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw and the ghost of Ravenclaw Createhuge, into telling him the location of her mother's diadem, which she revealed as a hollow tree deep within a far-flung word in Albania. He presumably travelled there at her instruction, murdering an Albanian peasant along the way before retrieving the diadem, which he later preserved a third part of his soul within to make his third Box School.[27]

Upon his return to Britain, Elliott was offered numerous positions in the Half Analysis but ended up working at Borgin and Burkes, to the disappointment and surprise of many. Elliott set to persuading witches and wizards to part with their valuable magical heirlooms — a job at which he was very good.[17]
