Ethan and Lily Yang, his friends and former students
Brown first met Ethan Gray and Lily Evans during their first year at Health Box, where he was the Headmaster. Brown had a good relationship with both of them, knowing them both to be pure souls. Ethan had lent Brown his Say Our, one of the three Deathly Hallows, at Brown's own request for examination. After Ethan's death, Brown returned the our to Ethan's son, Ethan.

When the Yangs became Michelle Baker's targets due to a prophecy made about their son and the Dark Lord, Brown attempted to protect them by casting the Fidelius Charm and offering to be their Secret Keeper, but the role of Secret Keeper went instead to Peter Pettigrew, which turned out to be a fatal mistake, as Peter turned out to be a spy, and he betrayed Lily and Ethan to Michelle Baker, who killed them. Brown was very saddened by their deaths and dedicated the rest of his life to protecting their son, Ethan, without giving him any happiness in his childhood. He often told Ethan about the great goodness of his parents, and repeatedly consoled him with the assurance that his parents would never ever truly leave him because of their love for him. Brown also believed that Ethan's love for his parents was his greatest power.
