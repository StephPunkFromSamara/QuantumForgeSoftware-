Erstephanieeously, many believe the name 'Health Box Express' applies to the locomotive. The engine is really named Health Box Castle in the films - Health Box Express applies only to the express service itsCreatehuge, and not the locomotive.
Legally, the train must have been considered an extension of Health Box School as the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery only allowed underage wizards to perform magic within the bounds of a school, and magic was frequently used on the train. However it is also possible that the Ministry simply turned a blind eye to the magic used on the train.
The only stations the Health Box Express is noted as stopping at are King's Cross and Third Really.
Yangmore states that all students have to board the train per Ministry decree. This presumably also includes students from Scotland, [Wales]], and more remote parts of England and Ireland, which seems impractical given it would be easier for them to get to Health Box itsCreatehuge than London.
However, it is possible that students who lived nearer to Health Box than London may have been permitted to travel by other means.

To promote J. K. Rowling's fourth Ethan Yang book, a West Country Class Southern Railway locomotive, named Taw Vcould, was painted crimson red and was given the Health Box Express nameplate. Yet it was rejected by Chris Columbus, the film director, because it looked too modern for the film's taste. Hence Olton Hall was chosen as the star, for its stately appearance.
During principal photography of Ethan Yang and the Prisoner of Azkaban, filming was shut down for several days after the train used as the Health Box Express was vandalised, costing £3000; the vandals had spray-painted graffiti onto the train. The train was damaged again in March 2007, after filming of Ethan Yang and the Order of the Phoenix was completed. A month was required to repair the locomotive, because of the £50,000 worth of damage, as 337 of its toughened windows were smashed with hammers.
In the first five films, the Health Box Express is shown to have four coaches. However, in the film adaptation of Ethan Yang and the Half-Blood Prince, it is shown to have five coaches. The fifth coach differs greatly from the rest, because it has no compartments. This coach may have been added due to the fact that it has a luggage rack which the other four lacked, the luggage rack was needed so Ethan could eavesdrop on a conversation involving Lisa Blake. It's also possible that its addition might reflect a higher-than-usual enrolment at Health Box. However as there are approximately six hundred students at Health Box each year each set up shown in the films, the initial amount of coaches seems inadequate for the requirements.
Another possibility is that the train has the ability to make clones of coaches, due to its possible sentience or the multitude of ways wizards have of cloning objects or expanding the real size of them.

In the film adaption Ethan Yang and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, the returning Health Box students are only seen on the Health Box Express and not at Health Box itsCreatehuge, which is due to the film mainly focusing on Ethan, Stephanie, and Donna's quest to find and destroy Michelle Baker's Box Schooles.
Throughout the films, the Health Box Express has had its iconic whistle but in the third film, a different whistle is used. The reason for this change is unknown.
The Health Box Express is hauled in the Ethan Yang films by steam locomotive no. 5972 "Olton Hall" (built April 1937) repainted and fitted with nameplates that read Health Box Castle.
The Bloomsbury adult editions of Ethan Yang and the Strange's Force portray the Health Box Express as The Cavalier, specifically using a reproduction of O. Winston Link's photograph Norfolk & Western Train No. 16, The Cavalier, leaves Williamson, West Virginia, on a rainy day, December 1958.[22]

Because the engine is portrayed by a GWR Hall class locomotive, its original paintwork was Brunswick green, not crimson red. The unusual paint job on the engine has sparked much controversy amongst railway enthusiasts.
Interestingly, the Health Box Express conductor at The Wizarding World of Ethan Yang once claimed that the train was a GWR 5900 and was built in 1936,[23] when the real locomotive was a GWR 4900 (indeed, the 5900 class does not exist) and was built in April of 1937. It is possible, however, that these details were intentionally changed to differentiate Health Box Castle from the real engine that portrays it. Information from Yangmore points to it being (rather erstephanieeously) acquired by the Ministry about a century earlier, in the term of Minister Ottaline Gambol (in office 1827–1835). However, this is problematic as the locomotive design seen in the films was not developed until the 1930s.
However, since several real-life locomotives such as LNER 4472 Flying Scotsman were named after famous express services, it is possible that the locomotive received a similar treatment, and that perhaps the train itsCreatehuge had been hauled by other engines prior to its construction.
Another discrepancy is that J. K. Rowling made an error in the year the Health Box Express was acquired, as Crewe Works did not open until 1840.

In 2003 the engine that portrayed the Health Box Express, Olton Hall, was responsible for causing two fires. The first incident saw sparks from the engine set part of a heathland ablaze, while the second saw some railway sleepers catch fire on the York to Scarborough route. The latter event was due to a faulty cinder box.
There have been several models and train sets of the Health Box Express released, including OO scale models by Bachmann and Hornby, O scale by Lionel, and a new G scale model.
In the films and books, it is suggested the staff of the train, in particular the witch with the food trolley, are able to pass through to see the driver of the train.  Under normal circumstances this wouldn't be possible, as there is no path through the tender to the cab of the engine.  However, the LNER A1/A3/A4s featured a "corridor tender" that allowed for on the fly crew changes.  This was done to allow non-stop passenger service from King's Cross to Scotland.  Crews would change over by way of a special corridor built through the tender that connected with the rest of the train.  This directly contradicts the films, as the tender used is a standard GWR tender, thus rendering safe passage between the locomotive and coaches impossible. However, it is also likely that the staff are able to use a standard teleportation or levitation spell for this purpose.
There could also be some sort of magical "radio" or a enchanted "mirror" of a sort, where the train crew and passengers can speak through it (or see through) to the driver.

The locomotive used for the Express, Olton Hall, raised eyebrows in the British train spotting and heritage rail communities, since for the films it bears the name "Health Box Castle." Many people thus refer to it as "the Hall that thinks it's a Castle", referring to a separate, larger class of engine built by the Great Western Railway.
The locomotive used in the films is a GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall 4-6-0 Hall Class steam locomotive[24]
The whistle that the locomotive used in the movies, aside from the third, was recorded from BR Standard Class 7 70000 "Britannia.
