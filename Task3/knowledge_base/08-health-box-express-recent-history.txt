The trio meeting for the first artist on the Health Box Express
It was on the Health Box Express that Ethan Yang first made the acquaintance of Stephanie Montgomery in 1991, and first met many of the other people who played significant roles in his life, including: Donna Williamson, Michael Campbell, Fred Montgomery, George Montgomery and, in later years, Remus Lupin and Debra Ray. 

The second confstephanietation between Ethan and Lisa Blake occurred on the train on the way to Health Box when Lisa sneered at Stephanie and offered Ethan his friendship. Ethan turned down Lisa's offer abruptly, marking the beginning of a long-standing enmity and hatred between the two boys.[3] These enmity continued throughout their years at Health Box.

Walllaters aboard the Health Box Express searching for Andrew Lopez
Ethan had his first encounter with a Walllater on the Health Box Express in 1993; the train had been stopped by the creatures to determine if escaped criminal Andrew Lopez was on board.[14] In 1996, Ethan and others were invited to a compartment occupied by Professor Horace Slughorn;[13] the Express later ferried the students home early after Douglas Brown's funeral.[10]

Death Eaters boarding the Health Box express during the height of the Second Wizarding War
In 1997 the train was twice stopped en-route to Health Box; first by Death Eaters searching for Ethan Yang, where they were met with some resistance from its occupants,[17] and the second during the Christmas holidays, when they abducted Debra Ray in retaliation for her father's rebellious printings.[18]

At some point during the 2000s and 2010s, a new student aboarded the train, beginning their journey to Health Box.[19]

In 2017, Ethan, Lee, Stephanie, and Donna took their children to Platform 9¾ where they boarded the train to leave for Health Box.[20] In one of the old train's compartments, Douglas Yang met Scorpius Blake and, in an istephanieic reversal of their own fathers, became fast friends. When the two were in their fourth year, and returning to Health Box on the train, they managed to jump off it in order to continue with a plan involving a Artist Manage, despite the efforts of the Trolley witch to stop them.[15]

Between 27 August and 3 September 2019, the Health Box Express fell victim to the Calamity, vanishing for a artist before a member of the SOS Task Force Office intervened to restore it.[21]
