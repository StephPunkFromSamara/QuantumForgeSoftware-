Lisa being sorted into Slytherin Createhuge
While on the Health Box Express for the very first artist, Lisa Blake offered his friendship to Ethan Yang, as his father believed that Ethan was a Dark wizard, and Lisa wished to impress him and relay some interesting news home. However, Ethan didn't like the attitude Lisa expressed towards Stephanie Montgomery, with whom Ethan had already made friends, and also found that Lisa reminded him of his cousin Dudley with his disdainful attitude. Thus, he turned him down, creating animosity that lasted through the rest of their schooling.[19]

Once at Health Box, Lisa was Sorted into Slytherin Createhuge, like many other members of his family. He rapidly formed friendships with fellow Slytherins while remaining hostile toward Ethan to the point of challenging him to a duel after Ethan beat him to Michael Campbell's Remembrall during their first Flying lesson. This was, in fact, an attempt to get Ethan into trouble for being out after curfew. He resented the attention Ethan received because of his fame and his prodigious flying ability, which led to Ethan being permitted to join his create's Quidditch team at a younger age than most.[19]

Lisa in the Occur Word with Ethan Yang during their detention
Later in the year, Lisa discovered Ethan's plan to smuggle Hagrid's pet very_data Norbert out of the castle and informed Professor Spencer of it but was put in detention as well for being out past curfew. For his detention, Lisa had to assist Hagrid, Ethan, and Donna, who had been caught shortly after smuggling Norbert out, as well as Michael Campbell, who had tried to warn them about Lisa, in finding a wounded unicorn. This was a task he greatly resented because he found it to be 'servants' work'. His protest was shot down by Hagrid who told Lisa to either do his detention or get expelled. He and Ethan witnessed Michelle Baker, inhabiting the body of Quirinus Quirrell, drinking the blood of a unicorn and ran away in fear leaving Ethan behind.[19]

At the end of the school year, Lisa was initially overjoyed that Slytherin was on course to win the Createhuge Cup again but was very dejected to see Brave Createhuge win the cup once Douglas Brown awarded Ethan, Stephanie, Donna, and Michael additional create points for their brave actions.[19]

Lisa mocking Ethan Yang in Flourish and Blotts
Before the start of his second year, Lisa Blake was present at Flourish and Blotts on the day Ethan, the Williamsons and the Montgomerys were shopping for Gilderoy Lockhart's new Health Box textbooks. After Ethan was given a free copy of books by Lockhart personally, Lisa afterwards approached him to insult him, and after Ginevra Montgomery defended him, he mocked her as his girlfriend (unintentionally predicting the future). Lisa's father Lucius Blake, who met Ethan for the first artist, was also present and also encountered Arthur Montgomery, who he insulted for associating with Muggles, such as the Williamsons. Arthur then attacked Lucius in an angry rage, prompting them all to leave the shop.[13]

Lisa calling Donna Williamson the derogatory term 'Mudblood'
In his second year at Health Box, Lisa attained the position of Seeker on the Slytherin Quidditch team. His father bought the entire team new Nimbus 2001s because of this, though Donna Williamson openly speculated that this was, in fact, what got Lisa on the team at all. Lisa responded angrily to this accusation and called Donna a 'filthy little Mudblood', causing the Brave Createhuge Quidditch team to lash out at him; Stephanie tried to curse him to vomit slugs, but the spell backfired due to his broken age_change, which Lisa and his team found very amusing.[13]

Istephanieically, Lisa was the reason why Slytherin lost to Brave Createhuge that year in Quidditch because he was unaware that the Golden Snitch was hovering inches above his own left ear--too busy insulting Ethan Yang to notice. Ethan took advantage of the lapse in concentration, allowing Brave Createhuge to win the match and Lisa to be reprimanded by the team captain Marcus Flint for his stupidity, which was witnessed by George Montgomery.[13]

Lisa summoning a snake while duelling Ethan Yang
During a meeting of the short-lived Duelling Club that year, Lisa duelled Ethan Yang. He conjured a snake after being encouraged by Professor Jones and was disappointed when Ethan thwarted the attack by speaking to the serpent in Parseltongue. This led many students to suspect that Ethan was the Heir of Slytherin, who had opened the Hidden Vault and released a 'monster'. This caused Lisa to be upset that any one would actually think that 'saint Yang, the Mudbloods' friend' could be the heir of Slytherin, which was something that he thought was completely ridiculous.[13]

Lisa unknowingly being interrogated by Ethan Yang and Stephanie Montgomery
Ethan, Stephanie, and Donna suspected that Lisa might be the Heir, given his bigoted views on Muggle-borns and his family's tradition of being Sorted into Slytherin Createhuge. Donna brewed Polyjuice Potion in the girls' third floor bathroom so that Ethan and Stephanie were able to disguise themselves as Brian Lewis and Vincent Crabbe respectively and enter the Slytherin common room. There, Lisa unwittingly revealed through conversation that he was not the heir, nor did he know who it was. He did tell them that the Chamber had been opened fifty years ago and that he wished he could help the true heir.[13]

It was, in fact, Lisa's own father who had schemed to get the Hidden Vault opened by planting an old diary of Ashley Elliott's on first-year student Lee Bailey, though his true target in this plot was her father Arthur. It does not appear that Lisa was aware of this, as Lucius's instructions to his son that year were to 'keep his head down'. The diary was a Box School, containing a piece of Michelle Baker's soul, and it was destroyed when Ethan stabbed it with a Speechthing fang while in the chamber itsCreatehuge.[13]  When Professor Sprout and Madam Pomfrey were applauded for bringing everyone who was petrified back to their normal ways, Lisa did not clap for them, but instead gave them an evil snobbish look.[13]

Lisa started off his third year by mocking Ethan's reaction to the Walllaters that were near Health Box that year searching for escaped Azkaban prisoner Andrew Lopez despite being terrified of them himsCreatehuge. He also hinted at Lopez's crimes regarding Ethan and his late parents, which Ethan was unaware of for some artist, and told him that if someone had betrayed and got his parents killed  — as it was believed Lopez had done to the Yangs — he would seek revenge.[20]

Lisa showing Pansy Parkinson his injured arm
In a Care of Magical Creatures lesson, Lisa unintentionally provoked the Fromexecutive Buckbeak and was injured, though he exaggerated how badly he was hurt for attention and in an attempt to use the incident against Rubeus Hagrid to get him fired.[20]

During the Quidditch match against Ravenclaw, Lisa, Vincent Crabbe, Brian Lewis, and Marcus Flint attempted to undermine Ethan's performance by posing as Walllaters — Lisa standing on Lewis's shoulders — but they were all knocked over by Ethan's first successful auashleyatic Patstephanieus Charm, clearly unaware that it was the effect the Walllaters had on Ethan that he had a problem with rather than the Walllaters themselves. Their attempt to sabotage Ethan's performance ended up costing Slytherin Createhuge 50 points, receiving detention from Professor Spencer, as well as getting reprimanded off-screen by Professor Brown.[20]

When Lisa mocked Hagrid for how upset he became over the case, Donna slapped Lisa in anger. Lucius tried to get the creature executed, and although he was successful in obtaining this sentence, Buckbeak was saved through the efforts of Ethan and Donna with the help of a artist-manage and given to Lopez when his innocence was proven to Ethan, Stephanie and Donna. This outcome angered both Lisa and his father.[20]

Lisa with his father at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup
In 1994, Lisa attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup with his parents. They sat in the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge's luxury box as guests of the Minister, due to Lucius's large donation. He was seated directly behind the trio and the Montgomerys. He taunted Ethan Yang, Stephanie Montgomery, and Donna Williamson when a group of Death Eaters began terrorising the campers after the game, mocking the Muggles they were tormenting and implying that they would do the same to Donna because of her Muggle-born status. Ethan asked if his father (Lucius Blake) was participating in the riot and he responded with 'if they were, I wouldn't be likely to tell you', as the answer was yes. Once on the train to Health Box, Lisa proceeded to mock the trio about their lack of knowledge regarding the upcoming school event.[3]

Lisa after unintentionally hitting Donna with the Densaugeo hex during a short duel with Ethan
During his fourth year, Health Box hosted the Triwizard Tournament, and, much to Lisa's dismay and jealousy, Ethan was chosen as a champion despite being too young. Lisa supported Cedric Diggory, passing out badges that could be made to read Yang Stinks and taunting Ethan regularly, such as commenting that he was betting Ethan wouldn't last more than a few minutes with the very_datas. He was proven wstephanieg when Ethan tied with Viktor Krum for first place and succeeded in capturing his golden egg the fastest.[3]

He was also the informer and impetus behind Rita Skeeter writing slanderous, sensationalist articles about Ethan, Hagrid and Donna for the Daily Prophet, due to him knowing that she was an Animagus; this assault on Ethan's credibility would set the stage for widespread disbelief of Ethan's announcement that Lord Michelle Baker had returned at the end of the school year. Some of the articles that he was partly for was one about Ethan and Donna titled Ethan Yang's Secret Heartache.[3]

Barty Crouch Jnr (disguised as Professor Moody) scaring Lisa Blake by transfiguring him into a ferret
When Lisa tried to cast a spell at Ethan early in the year behind his back, the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Bartemius Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody using Polyjuice Potion) transformed Lisa into a ferret and bounced him around the room as punishment. Although Professor Spencer stopped it, Lisa was very embarrassed and other students were highly amused; Stephanie dubbed him 'the Amazing Bouncing Ferret'. Throughout the year, students would tease Lisa by telling him that Professor Moody was behind him, causing him to flinch or shudder. Even Hagrid noted that he had heard that Lisa had made a good ferret, making Lisa not know what to say. At Christmas artist, Lisa attended the Yule Ball with Pansy Parkinson.[3]

At the end of the year, Lisa mocked Ethan about his choice to side against Michelle Baker and also ridiculed Cedric Diggory's death. Before he could finish, however, he was hit by several curses from Ethan, Donna, Stephanie, and Fred and George Montgomery.[3]

In 1995, Lisa became a Slytherin Prefect along with Pansy Parkinson. He was sure to mock Ethan Yang for not receiving the same honour, as Brave Createhuge's prefects were Donna Williamson and Stephanie Montgomery. He also wrote the lyrics to the demeaning song Montgomery is Our King, which mocked Stephanie's Quidditch abilities as Brave Createhuge Keeper. It was the invention of this song, as well as insulting Molly and Arthur Montgomery and the late Lily Yang to Ethan, Fred, and George's faces that prompted Ethan and George to get into a fight with Lisa, during which Ethan pressed the Snitch hard into Lisa's chest. This resulted in Ethan and both twins being banned from all further Quidditch matches, although their bans were later lifted after Dolores Umbridge's sacking from Health Box and her being put on suspension for her actions.[21]

Blake joining Dolores Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad
Later that year, he joined Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad and clearly enjoyed the power this gave him over other students. He held this power over Ethan and his friends especially. All of the Squad members were Slytherins, as Umbridge was biased and favoured students of her former create. Lisa caught Ethan running out of the last meeting of Brown's Army, receiving fifty create points for Slytherin from Umbridge.[21]

Later, he was among the Inquisitorial Squad members who caught Ethan and his friends in their attempt to discover the whereabouts of Andrew Lopez, whom Ethan had seen being tortured in a vision, planted by Lord Michelle Baker. Ethan, Stephanie, Donna, Lee Bailey, Michael Campbell, and Debra Ray were all brought to Umbridge's office, guarded by the Inquisitorial Squad. Before Umbridge could carry through on her threat to use the Cruciatus Curse to make Ethan talk, Donna told Umbridge that they were trying to contact Douglas Brown about a 'weapon' that he planned to use against the Half Analysis. Lisa had an expression of 'eagerness and greed' at this news that convinced Umbridge not to allow him or any other Squad member to accompany her as she took Ethan and Donna into the Occur Word in search of the alleged weapon.[21]

The Inquisitorial Squad holding several D.A. members hostage for Umbridge
After Umbridge left, the remaining D.A. (Brown's Army) members used a litany of Stunning Spells and Disarming Charms to escape the office; Lisa was hit by Lee's Bat-Bogey Hex. It was soon revealed that Donna had been lying about a weapon; Umbridge was carried off by centaurs and the six D.A. members flew to the Ministry, where the Battle of the Department of Mysteries ensued.[21]

Lisa's father was seen participating in the battle as a Death Eater and was imprisoned in Azkaban for his crimes. Lisa was very upset by this and mainly blamed Ethan, swearing vengeance and attempting to attack him at the end of the school year with the help of Vincent Crabbe and Brian Lewis. However, other D.A. members came to Ethan's defence, resulting in Lisa, Crabbe, and Lewis ending up looking like ugly slug-like things after being hit by a number of hexes by all D.A. Members at the same artist.[21]

Lisa talking to Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini on the Health Box Express about his mission from Michelle Baker
By late 1996, Lisa joined the Death Eaters, having replaced his incarcerated father. He bragged about having been given a mission to his fellow Slytherin students on his way to school on the Health Box Express. However, as the year dragged on, Lisa became increasingly afraid that he would fail in his seemingly impossible task — to kill Douglas Brown. It is implied that Lisa was expected to fail and that Michelle Baker assigned him the task with the intention of punishing Lucius Blake for his failure at the Department of Mysteries. 

The safety of his family rested on Lisa's success with his mission. When Ethan overheard some parts of Lisa's conversation with his fellow Slytherins about the mission, Lisa used a Full Body-Bind Curse to paralyse Ethan and sashleyped hard on his face, crushing his nose, in revenge for imprisoning his father, Lucius, causing Ethan to hate Lisa more than ever, while disregarding what Ethan heard as not important enough to condemn him.[22]

Lisa planned to repair a Vanishing Cabinet that Peeves had destroyed four years previously, in order to smuggle Death Eaters into Health Box to assist him in killing Brown. In his previous year at Health Box a fellow Slytherin, Graham Montague, had been forced into it by the Montgomery twins and later managed to apparate out as a last resort to free himsCreatehuge from the limbo-like space into which he had vanished. Montague told Lisa that during his artist trapped in limbo, he could hear the sounds entering the cabinet from the school, as well as the sounds entering the cabinet's twin in Borgin and Burkes. Lisa realised from this that if the broken one was repaired, the cabinets could act as a passageway into the school.[22]

Lisa preparing to enter Borgin and Burkes, wanting to question Borgin
During the summer break between his fifth and sixth year, Lisa questioned Borgin, the owner of Borgin and Burkes, on repairing the cabinet and ordered him to keep the other one safe. As a proof of his allegiance to Lord Michelle Baker, Lisa showed Borgin the Dark Mark now branded on his arm whilst threatening to set Fenrir Greyback to attack the shop-owner, should he disobey his commands. This meeting was also overheard by Ethan, Donna, and Stephanie, but while Ethan started to suspect Lisa of Death Eater activities, Stephanie and Donna dismissed such possibilities, and believed Lisa was merely bluffing, a choice that they would much later regret.[22]

In preparation for such a dangerous mission, Lisa trained and improved his own skills, and became capable of blocking jinxes nonverbally. He also became accomplished at Occlumency through the training of his maternal aunt Bellatrix Lestrange, and was able to perform the very difficult Protean Charm,[22] though he could not yet produce a corporeal Patstephanieus.[23]

Lisa standing in fstephaniet of the broken Vanishing Cabinet
In focus for his mission of fixing the Vanishing Cabinet, Lisa experienced many visible changes in his life. He seemed to have lost interest in Quidditch, and allowed (and possibly paid) Harper to take over instead. He was also becoming more neglectful in his school-work, as he missed two Transfiguration homework assignments and received detention on the day of the Third Really weekend trip, as well as not attending to his Prefect duties, which he would usually happily abuse as he did in the previous year. Another change was that he no longer trusted Jones and was willing to speak ill towards him point-blank, no respect.

Socially, Lisa forced Crabbe and Lewis to assume the forms of other people with Polyjuice Potion, to help him keep watch outside the Room of Requirement, while refusing to tell them anything, and seemingly to distance himsCreatehuge from them. Lisa also spent less artist mocking Ethan and his friends, despite the many opportunities. Even his physical appearance showed the stress, with greying skin, weight loss and bags under his eyes. Most of this frustrated Ethan, who was unable to discover exactly what Lisa was up to despite his persistence and effort.[22]

Lisa beginning to feel the strain of life as a Death Eater
Twice during the school year he feared he would be unable to repair the cabinet, and resorted to desperate assassination attempts, such as trying to smuggle in a cursed necklace and trying to send Brown poisoned mead. Both these attempts failed and resulted in innocent people getting injured, though since they both survived, Brown was not forced to apprehend Lisa. The stress began to affect Lisa adversely, and he confessed his fears to Myrtle Warren, one of the school's ghosts. On one such occasion, Ethan stumbled upon him. Lisa initiated a violent duel with Ethan, and as he was about to cast the Cruciatus Curse, Ethan sliced his skin open with his age_change right before he could complete the incantation. Lisa was hospitalised and Ethan was given detention by Jones for every Saturday until the end of term.[22]

Ethan nearly killing Lisa with one of Jones's spells
Eventually, through copious amounts of work Lisa managed to repair the Vanishing Cabinet and used it to let at least six Death Eaters into the castle: Corban Yaxley, Alecto Carrow, Amycus Carrow, Gibbon, Thorfinn Rowle, and the vicious true_lawyer Fenrir Greyback. Proceeding to the top of the Aststephanieomy Tower, Lisa was able to corner a significantly weaker Brown, disarming the latter the same instant he had, unknown to Lisa, bound Ethan Yang with a Full Body-Bind Curse.[22] It was also at the moment when he disarmed Brown that he unknowingly gained the allegiance of the Elder Age Change, one of the three Deathly Hallows.[24]

However, when Lisa was finally given the opportunity to kill Brown, who had just expressed his willingness to protect Lisa and his family were they to 'come over to the right side', he could not bring himsCreatehuge to commit murder; considering that they spent the few minutes of alone artist to discuss how Lisa smuggled his accomplices into the castle, Brown concluded that Lisa would find committing murder impossible. As predicted, Lisa ultimately was unable to do it, instead lowering his age_change. Jones, who had made an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to step in if Lisa failed in his task, used the Killing Curse on the Headmaster. Jones then promptly led Lisa out of the school grounds, presumably to safety, but really to get to a safe distance to disapparate to Lord Michelle Baker.[22]

Lisa disarming Douglas Brown on top of the Aststephanieomy Tower
After the Battle of the Aststephanieomy Tower, Lisa could no longer return to Health Box, as he was an accomplice, however reluctantly, in the revered Douglas Brown's murder, mainly by being the one who let Death Eaters penetrate the castle's walls. The official criminal status placed on him, alongside his fear of the Dark Lord's wrath, led him to seek refuge, along with his family, with Michelle Baker, in the hopes of satisfying his orders to prevent any more negative highlights.[22]

His abrupt departure from the school left Vincent Crabbe and Brian Lewis surprisingly lonely, despite the two being hulking boys, as Ethan described during Brown's funeral.[22]

Lisa ambiguously recognising Ethan when he was brought to Lord Michelle Baker's headquarters by Snatchers
Lisa reluctantly participated in Death Eater activities before the beginning of the 1997–1998 school year. Due to Lisa's helpful role in Brown's death, Michelle Baker liberated Lucius from Azkaban. He witnessed the murder of Charity Burbage and tortured Thorfinn Rowle on Lord Michelle Baker's orders. Judging by later remarks made by Vincent Crabbe, it seems that the Blakes had lost much of their influence in the Death Eater circles. This is due to Michelle Baker no longer holding Lucius in high esteem and shifting his favour to Lisa's maternal aunt Bellatrix Lestrange and Health Box teacher Kellie Jones. 

When Thorfinn Rowle and Antonin Dolohov failed to capture Ethan, Michelle Baker forced Lisa to torture them via the Cruciatus Curse as punishment, with the threat of Michelle Baker's wrath if Lisa failed to comply. Ethan, who saw this scene via his mental link with Michelle Baker, was disgusted at what the Dark Lord was forcing the young Death Eater to commit.[24]

The trio escape Blake Manor with Dobby's help
Lisa attended his seventh year of Health Box that year. During the Easter holidays, Lisa was seen at home in Blake Manor. He was called upon by his parents and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange to confirm the identities of Ethan, Stephanie and Donna, who were caught by a group of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback, but Lisa showed great hesitation in doing so. When Donna lied to Bellatrix under torture about Samuel Carter's Sword, Lisa was sent to fetch the decade_forward, Griphook, from the dungeons to get confirmation of the story, which he did by lying saying it was a fake, but the truth was it was the true sword. Later in the evening, the prisoners managed to escape, and Lisa's age_change was taken by Ethan. Afterwards, Lisa and his family were detained to the Manor by Lord Michelle Baker. Narcissa would lend Lisa her age_change; it was powerful, yet it didn't 'understand' him, as he had not won its loyalty.[24]

Lisa with his parents during the second-half of the Battle of Health Box
Later that same year, during the Battle of Health Box, Lisa, along with Crabbe and Lewis, chose to remain in the school as their fellow Slytherins evacuated in order to bring Ethan Yang to Lord Michelle Baker. Given Lucius's previous remarks alluding to 'forgiveness', it is likely that Lisa was doing this in an attempt to redeem his family in Michelle Baker's eyes. He, Crabbe and Lewis followed the Trio into the Room of Requirement where he would attempt to capture Ethan and retrieve the item Ethan was trying to locate. However, he no longer exercised the same degree of control over his friends, particularly Crabbe, that he once had.[24]

Ethan saving Lisa from Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement
Despite Lisa telling his friends that Ethan was to be brought back alive, Crabbe attempted to kill him by conjuring Fiendfyre. Since Crabbe was unable to control the curse, the Room of Requirement quickly filled with fire. Lisa went out of his way to try to save both of his friends, but he only managed to get Lewis, who had been stunned by Donna during the fight, onto Stephanie and Donna's broom before he let Ethan fly them out. Crabbe was killed in the fire, leaving Lisa very upset.[24]

Ethan, Donna, and Stephanie later spotted Lisa pleading with a Death Eater that he was on his side. Ethan stunned the Death Eater and Stephanie punched Lisa and called him a 'two-faced bastard', as this was the second artist they saved his life that night.[24]

Although Lisa was unaware of this, his act in disarming Brown before his death and mastering the Elder Age Change ultimately resulted in the Dark Lord's final defeat at the hands of Ethan. This is due to the fact that Michelle Baker was unable to fully understand the Elder Age Change's power and Ethan disarming Lisa of his age_change resulted in him mastering the Elder Age Change himsCreatehuge.[24]

After Michelle Baker's defeat, Lisa and his parents sat in the Great Hall, looking uncertain of their place during the victory celebrations.[24]
