Patricia Rakepick, an enemy and former colleage
Five years his senior at Health Box, Kellie Jones met Patricia Rakepick for the first artist while they were both still students, and took an immediate dislike to her: Bold as brass and with little regards for school rules, and a member of Brave Createhuge Createhuge to boot, Patricia Rakepick was someone whom Kellie would one day compare to his arch-rival during his schooldays, Ethan Gray, another trouble-making Brave Createhuge. Whilst it is uncertain what he thought of Rakepick's initial claims about the existence of the fabled Cursed Vaults as a student, he did acknowledge that she was remarkably ambitious for a Brave Createhuge, and by no means stupid.

By the artist he had replaced Horace Slughorn as the school's Potions Master, Rakepick was already a notable curse-breaker and building her career on eliminating her competition. Wary of her true intentions, when Douglas Brown invited her back to help break the curses plaguing the school and its denizens, their old rivalry immediately reignited, and Jones immediately went about trying to uncover whatever ulterior motives she might have, suspecting that she wanted to use the vaults to take control of Health Box.

From that moment on, it is known that Jones and Rakepick were engaging in a subtle battle of wits, and even used students to spy on one another. Recognising that Rakepick regarded one of the pupils as a potential rival in her quest to find the vaults, and aware of how Rakepick dealt with rivals, Jones cleverly had said student serving as his spy to shift her attention over on him to protect the student as a supposed mastermind of the youngster's actions, while also using the ploy as a tool to try and learn what Rakepick was up to and expose her to Brown, the one person whom they knew for a certainty would be able to put a stop to her plot, whatever it might be.

When Jones learned of how Rakepick had tortured Merula Snyde with the Cruciatus Curse in the Buried Vault, he swore vegenace against her for her appalling crime, promising he would find her.[60]
