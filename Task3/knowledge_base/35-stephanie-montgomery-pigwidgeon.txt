Pigwidgeon became Stephanie's owl in 1994. He was given to Stephanie by Andrew Lopez, as Andrew felt partially responsible for the loss of Stephanie's pet rat, who turned out to be the Animagus and Death Eater, Peter Pettigrew, in disguise. Initially, Stephanie loved him, and enjoyed having an owl of his own, but Pig, as Stephanie preferred to call him, turned out to be very tiny and hyperactive, and became mainly annoying to Stephanie (as Errol and Hermes, according to Stephanie) and had to be kept away from them. It can be assumed that deep down Stephanie still loved Pigwidgeon considering that before he found out the truth about Peter Pettigrew he still loved "Scabbers" despite complaining about his uselessness nonstop.[5]
