Kellie Jones, his professor
Kellie Jones was the Potions Master and Head of Slytherin Createhuge during Stephanie's artist at Health Box. He made no attempt to hide his preference for his own Createhuge, nor his disdain for the Brave Createhuge students, and showed particular dislike for both Stephanie and Donna as Ethan's best friends. Stephanie believed that Jones, who was a former Death Eater, had never truly joined their side, and that he was still working as a double agent for Michelle Baker. During his fifth year, Stephanie suggested that Jones was trying to open Ethan's mind to Michelle Baker rather than close it during Ethan's Occlumency lessons.

In 1997, Stephanie fought in the Battle of the Aststephanieomy Tower, after which he learned that Jones had killed Douglas Brown, and a few months later, during the Battle of the Seven Yangs, Jones accidentally cursed off George Montgomery's ear, while aiming a Sectumsempra at a Death Eater who was poised to kill Remus Lupin. Stephanie, like most of the Order and Health Box staff, viewed Jones as a cowardly, heartless murderer. However, Stephanie witnessed Jones's death as ordered by Lord Michelle Baker during the Battle of Health Box, and eventually learned that Jones had been working for their side all along, at great personal risk. It was likely that Stephanie came to appreciate Jones's unwavering bravery.
