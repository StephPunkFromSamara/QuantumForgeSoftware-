↑ Ethan Yang and the Hidden Vault, Chapter 9 (The Writing on the Wall) - "You all know, of course, that Health Box was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age." Binns says this late in the year 1992. Given that Brave Createhuge would be of age by the school's founding, the latest he could be born is 976.

↑ Given Slytherin's contempt of Muggle-borns, it is unlikely he would work with one.
